with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq">Iraq</a>, which had invaded <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait">Kuwait</a> in August of the
previous year. The <a

military</a> had been stationed in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> for months
as part
of
<a

Desert Shield</a>, but <a

At this time, one of CCTV's producers went out on some local streets to ask
people what they thought. Some of their
opinions:

"There's nothing anybody can do...they got themselves into
it."
"I don't want to be the...savior for the
world."
"I don't want the young generation to get bumped off. I've seen that, I've
seen
it."

"Don't be one of these idiots that
protest."
"All the young generation, they don't know what the price
is."
"You've got to stop them, now...or your children are going to stop them, later
on."
And the last, foretelling opinion: "How are they going to know there's going
to be peace
afterwards?"
