For my generation the Russians have always been the Russians. I never knew
them as the Soviets, except retroactively. And the only connection between
them and ships I can think of is the Cuban Missile Crisis, which happened in,
you know, Cuba. Not off the coast of Cape Cod. So I was very surprised to come
across a batch of cards about the presence of Russian ships off the
Massachusetts coast, my favorite of which
reads:

&nbsp;
<blockquote>Russian Ships: in Westport, negotiations re: lobster
boat.</blockquote>
There were a couple innocent sounding ones about interactions between American
and Russian fishing boats, but there were also more threatening sounding
stories like: “<strong>Russian Sailor Brought in for Treatment</strong>,”
“<strong>Russian Trawlers at Sea</strong>,” “<strong>Russian Seaman
Rescued</strong>.”

My interest was piqued, so I began to research what the heck Russian ships
were doing off the coast of the Cape in the early 1970s. It turns out that the
Russians were busy bulking up their naval presence, and were quickly becoming
a <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/4277742"
target="_blank">threat</a> in this respect. Even though the Russian presence
along the East Coast was mostly for fishing, tensions were
high.

In 1971 <a href="http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=216859"
target="_blank">Walter Cronkite</a> reported on disputes between USSR and US
fishermen about activity off the coast of Cape Cod.  <strong>American
lobstermen had their lines cuts by Soviet trawlers</strong>, and they
suspected it to be deliberate. It was also speculated that many of the Russian
trawlers were only there under the guise of fishing, but were actually there
to spy on the position of American
ships.

&nbsp;

Americans were so suspicious (a characteristic of the time, or so I hear)
that, according to <a
href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873133,00.html"
target="_blank">Time
Magazine</a>:
<blockquote>Spurred by the presence of Russian trawlers that have invaded
traditional U.S. fishing areas off the Northeast coast, the Senate passed a
bill empowering the Administration to penalize foreign fishing vessels that
venture into U.S. territorial waters, and extending U.S. jurisdiction to
include the waters of the continental
shelf.</blockquote>
Essentially we went from monitoring the sea up to 3 miles off the coast to
monitoring up to <a
href="http://books.google.com/books?id=CeQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"
target="_blank">200 miles</a> off the coast. Possibly this legal action was
the result of the <a href="http://www.vsa.cape.com/~harharb/herringregs.html"
target="_blank">devastation of the Cape Cod fishing industry</a> by Russian
trawlers or maybe it was the paranoia (founded or unfounded) of the
time.

All of the politics and international affairs aside, there were some really
engaging stories about the specific people involved. Trying to discover who
were the rescued and sick Russian sailors mentioned in the cards, I stumbled
on some noteworthy finds, the most interesting of which is probably the story
of <a href="//www.mvmagazine.com/2005/not-summer/simas_kudirka.php"
target="_blank">Simas Kudirka</a>, a Soviet sailor who tried to defect by
jumping from his ship to an American ship, with disastrous results. This story
is so dramatic that they made actually made it into a <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077418/" target="_blank">TV movie</a>
starring Alan Arkin as Kudirka. This is an excellent story to get beyond the
politics (although there are a lot of politics involved) and focus on the
actual people
involved.

What do you remember about coverage of the Russians during the Cold
War?
Was it all at the national level, or do you also remember some local stories,
like
these?
