  <member><name>description</name><value><string>This project is a collaborative community effort to build a central repository of local historical digitized news. We hope teachers will use the video resources to enhance their lessons. In addition to the videos and descriptions available directly through our website, PBS LearningMedia has created &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/collection/bln12/&quot;&gt;video resources&lt;/a&gt; from our archival collection, along with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/bln13.soc.ush.lpprimsrc/using-primary-sources-to-connect-the-past-and-present/&quot;&gt;lesson plan&lt;/a&gt;.

We will be adding links to each video resource soon.
&lt;div id=&quot;studentblog&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Blog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We're proud to showcase the work students have done with materials from our collection. As a final product from the PBS LearningMedia lesson plan, students can write blogs posts about their work with primary sources. These are submitted to us by the teacher, and published on our website.
&lt;div id=&quot;digitization&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request Digitization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We’re very excited to offer a remarkable feature that allows users to access any item in our catalog. Through our Digitization on Demand program you can select any artifact from our catalog of over 50,000 items, and help save a piece of local history by sponsoring its preservation. It’s easy. If you come across an items that you’re excited to see digitized and preserved, all you have to do is request it. We’ll contact you about the costs of digitization, and soon the video will be streaming on our site for free public access.

  <member><name>description</name><value><string>&lt;strong&gt;A &amp;amp; B Rolls&lt;/strong&gt; A and B rolls [are] two rolls of negative and positive elements which are used by the filmmaker to hide splices and create fades and dissolves by alternating back and forth between the two rolls. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;[11. Pg. 13]&lt;/a&gt;

Paired production elements that are printed in succession to hide transitions or splices between shots and to produce fades or dissolves. Created by splicing negative or positive film into two rolls. Where one carried the picture, the other has black or blank leader. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;[5. Pg. 99]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Aerial (shot)&lt;/strong&gt; An extremely high angle view of a subject usually taken from a crane or a high stationary camera position, but may also refer to a shot taken from an actual airplane or helicopter. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Air&lt;/strong&gt; The medium for radio and TV broadcasting. A station or program, when broadcast, is on the air or airing. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Answer Print&lt;/strong&gt; An answer print is the film print that is used as a presentation copy once all the scenes have been checked for quality in the printing and the corrections have been made. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;[11. Pg. 14]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Feature&lt;/strong&gt; A longer article or radio story, usually in greater depth and complexity than a simple news item. Features may grow from a current news event or simply be examining a timeless issue. Features which are not strongly connected to hard news events are often called soft features. In radio, features usually have a mixture of elements, including the reporter’s voice, interviews and other sounds. Longer features may be called documentaries. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Feed&lt;/strong&gt; The transfer of information from a source to a recipient, whether raw information from reporter to studio or finished reports fed to a transmitter or another station for broadcast. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;File Footage or File&lt;/strong&gt; A completed television news story pre-prepared for a news bulletin and ready for transmission. A package will contain a written introduction for the newsreader, the reporter’s edited report complete with vision and sound and an out-cue for the end. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Folo or Follow up&lt;/strong&gt; A story which is written to report new or more detailed information on a story which has already been published or broadcast. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Magnetic Track&lt;/strong&gt; Magnetic tracks or ‘mag’ tracks are very thin strips of what looks like magnetic audiotape applied to the film. The magnetic track is read by a playback head in the projector during viewing. Magnetic tracks can also be found as a reel of what appears to be blank copper-colored film. The audio track can be detected when the reel is played on piece of equipment capable of playing sound film. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;[11. Pg. 14]&lt;/a&gt;

Film carrying the reverse image of the subject. The negative is exposed in the camera or created from a positive in the laboratory. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;[5. Pg. 105]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;n.c.&lt;/strong&gt; News Conference. Also called press conference... When reporters are gathered together to question someone in the news, usually taking it in turns to ask questions. Such gatherings are usually organized by an individual or company to deal with all the media in one session or to promote a new product or service. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Optical Track&lt;/strong&gt; The optical track appears along the edge of the film as a wavy white line or a gray stripe that varies in shade. The sound track is exposed onto the film during printing. The optical track is read as light passes through it, thus the name ‘optical.’ &lt;a href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;[11. Pg. 14]&lt;/a&gt;

Photographically printed sound record carried on the film print or produced as a separate element. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;[5. Pg. 105]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Outs&lt;/strong&gt; Outtakes are pieces of film that did not make it into the final edited version. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;[11. Pg. 14]&lt;/a&gt;

Footage not used in a completed film &lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;[5. Pg. 105]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Package or Pkg&lt;/strong&gt; A completed television news story pre-prepared for a news bulletin and ready for transmission. A package will contain a written introduction for the newsreader, the reporter’s edited report complete with vision and sound and an out-cue for the end. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn10&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Pix Or Pics&lt;/strong&gt; Local term used in WHDH Collection and WCVB Collection Sheets. Relates to footage filmed for news stories.

&lt;strong&gt;POS&lt;/strong&gt; Local term used in the WGBH Ten O’Clock News Collection to signify “person on the street” – short interviews with the public to garner local opinions on topics of the day. Can also be known as Vox Pops, see The News manual.

&lt;strong&gt;Print films&lt;/strong&gt; A print is a copy of the film made from the negative. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;[11. Pg. 13]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Reax. Or Reactions&lt;/strong&gt; Local term used in WCVB Collection Assignment Sheets to signify people’s reactions or opinions about a news story.

&lt;strong&gt;R.E. or Real Estate&lt;/strong&gt; Local term used in WHDH Collection and WCVB Collection Assignment Sheets to signify location footage relating to a news story, such as Harvard Yard.

&lt;strong&gt;Reel&lt;/strong&gt; Metal or plastic hub with extended sides between which film is wound for projection. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;[5. Pg. 106]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Reversal film&lt;/strong&gt; Camera reversal means that the same film that runs through the camera comes back from the lab as a positive image. This is similar to a slide in photography. There is no matching negative for the original film which makes it the only copy in existence. It cannot be reconstructed if damaged or destroyed. To identify reversal film and distinguish it from a print, look at the edge of the film. A black edge indicated reversal film while a clear edge means that it is probably a print and was produced from a negative. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn11&quot;&gt;[11. Pg. 13]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;SIL&lt;/strong&gt; Silent. Silent film. Film made without a sound track. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot;&gt;[5. Pg. 107]&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Sketches&lt;/strong&gt; Local term used in WHDH Collection and WCVB Collection Sheets. Related to artists’ rendition of people, used mainly during court proceedings.

  <member><name>description</name><value><string>Thank you for visiting bostonlocaltv.org (the “Site”), owned and maintained by WGBH Educational Foundation (“WGBH”). The Boston TV News Digital Library: 1960-2000 Project (the “Project”) was created by WGBH in collaboration with the following “Project Partners”: Boston Public Library, Cambridge Community Television and Northeast Historic Film. This Site serves to document and share the progress of the Project with the public.

We know you don’t want the information you provide us shared indiscriminately. Here we explain what information WGBH and our third-party vendors and Project Partners (collectively “we”) acting on our behalf to help deliver the services and operate and analyze use of the Site collect, what we do with the information, and what controls you have over the information collected. We’re committed to ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information, and to protecting your ability to make financial transactions (if available on this Site) and transmit your personal data with full confidence.

The privacy policy set forth here refers solely to bostonlocaltv.org. Please read it carefully, and if you have any questions or concerns, please contact us. Also, note that bostonlocaltv.org links to numerous other sites, such as WGBH, the Boston Public Library, Cambridge Community Television and Northeast Historic Film. Please consult those sites to learn more about their policies and terms of use.

&lt;strong&gt;1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?&lt;/strong&gt;

We collect two types of information from you: a) personally identifiable information, which includes personal information (such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card information (if financial transactions are available on this Site) and/or other identifying information) you voluntarily supply upon request when you register for the Site, make a donation, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a contest or sweepstakes, and/or comment on the Site; and b) Non-personally identifiable information, for example IP Addresses and cookies, which include tracking information collected as you navigate through our Site. Uses of this information are discussed in Section 2 below.

A. Personally Identifiable Information

We will not collect personally identifiable information from you, other than what you supply to us on a voluntary basis upon request.

&lt;em&gt;Registration for our website: &lt;/em&gt;
Anyone can view our Site, however some functions of the Site may require a free registration which enables full access to the information and resources offered throughout the Site. A unique email address (user name) and password must be supplied to register. By using the Site, you are agreeing to the conditions of our Terms of Use.

&lt;em&gt;Support of the Site and the WGBH Media Library and Archives:&lt;/em&gt;
On certain pages within the Site we may now or in the future offer visitors the opportunity to make a donation in support of the Site and the WGBH Media Library and Archives. If a visitor chooses to make a donation, we will collect and store your telephone number, email address, billing address and credit card information.

&lt;em&gt;Feedback and Content Submissions:&lt;/em&gt;
On certain pages within the Site you may be able to submit content to be published, such as tags, annotations, and make comments and vote. We may collect your name, address, and email addresses in connection with these activities. We will indicate which information is required and which is optional. We may contact users regarding their submissions in certain circumstances.

&lt;em&gt;Your submission of others’ Personally Identifiable Information:&lt;/em&gt;
On certain pages within the Site you may be able to submit information about other people. For example, you may submit a person’s name and email address to send an article. This information will only be used for your intended purpose.

&lt;em&gt;Email and Email Newsletters:&lt;/em&gt;
On occasion, we may collect personal information from users in connection with optional emails and email newsletters. We will indicate which information is required and which is optional. Such information will be used as indicated at the time of collection.

&lt;em&gt;Marketing and Promotional Communications:&lt;/em&gt;
On occasion, we may collect personal information from users in connection with optional marketing and promotional communications from WGBH, PBS or other entities. We will indicate which information is required and which is optional. Such information will be used as indicated at the time of collection.

B. Non-personally Identifiable Information

In addition to information that you provide to us, we may also collect and store certain non-personally identifiable information automatically when you use the Site. This information helps us improve the experience you and other visitors have with the Site.

For example, we may collect your IP address, browser information and reference site domain, as well as related information such as the date on which you visit the Site. This information does not identify you personally and is only used in the aggregate.

As is common practice among web sites, we use “cookies” and similar technologies. In general, cookies – the informational files that your web browser places on your computer when you visit a website – are used on this Site to track and analyze how you and other visitors use our Site. We use these cookies in order to improve the Site, to identify the source of visitors and what pages you use while on our site, to offer visitors interactive and/or personalized features that would not be possible without the cookies, to recall specific information to save visitors time when they return to the Site, to provide our sponsors targeted sponsorship opportunities, to provide visitors customized sponsorship messages or list of customized videos of interest, and to identify usage and statistical trends. By looking at this traffic we can better understand our community, which allows us to improve our Site and to provide you with an optimal experience and better service. Our sponsorship service vendors, which serve sponsorship messages onto our site, and third party vendors that measure and analyze the use of the Site for us, may also use their own cookies. At no time does the cookie reveal your name, address, or email address (even if you have entered these in specific areas of the Site). The Site pages cannot extract any personally identifying information about you from what we receive via a cookie and your browser.
We also allow third-party companies, including AddThis, to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our Site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice, you can visit www.networkadvertising.org.

You can set your browser preferences to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so.

&lt;strong&gt;2. HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION GATHERED ON THE SITE?&lt;/strong&gt;

Neither WGBH, nor our third-party vendors acting on our behalf to help deliver the services and operate the Site, will willfully disclose, sell, exchange or lend any personally identifiable information about our online users to any third party other than Project Partners without first receiving the user’s permission, unless disclosure to third party(ies) is required by law, we believe in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency, or such release is necessary to protect anyone’s rights, property or safety.
In terms of our own use of information, we may use your personally identifiable information for the activities described in the previous sections, for the activities described when you submitted the information, or for internal and marketing promotional purposes as further described in this policy.
We will typically explain the extent of use at the time you are asked to provide personal information. If you do not want this information to be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply “opt out.” Under certain circumstances, opting out may prevent your participation in activities for which personal information is needed, as in contests or sweepstakes.

As mentioned, in certain cases, we contract with third party vendors to provide services on our behalf. These vendors maintain customer databases with email addresses of Site visitors who have provided their email addresses to us by registering at our site, signing up for a newsletter or email, emailing us questions about the service, donors who submit online contributions, or online buyers who make a purchase. We will use these addresses to respond to the general purposes for which we collected the information, to provide services and to operate the Site, including to respond to inquiries; to process credit card payments, billing, and shipping; to process email distribution; for list processing and analysis; for promotions management; to send information about WGBH’s programs, services, or your local public broadcasting station’s membership/fundraising; or to correspond about purchase or product offers. Our third party vendors have access to your personally identifiable information as necessary to provide certain services on our behalf. They are required to maintain the privacy of all such information in their possession or control and can only use the information for the purpose that we have contracted them, for example sending you a newsletter. They are not authorized to use your information for any other purpose.

Similarly, personally identifiable information provided in connection with a donation will be shared with third party vendors who perform services to process the donation.

On certain pages, we may now or in the future, offer visitors the opportunity to provide comments, messages or other user-generated text, content or materials (collectively “User Materials”). Any information that you disclose when posting a message to these areas, such as your name, screen name or ID used, becomes public. In addition, we may use the information that you disclose in these areas for promotional and marketing purposes. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to disclose in these public areas. Further, we may use, copy, sublicense, modify, transmit, publicly perform, display, create derivative works of, host, index, cache, tag, encode, and/or adapt any User Materials, and any information contained therein, in any and all media formats or channels, whether now known or hereafter devised, including, but not limited to, the Site, public broadcasting station web sites, other third party web sites, over the air (on radio or television), and on mobile platforms.

You may also have the opportunity to engage with our content on the Site, such as video, text or other offerings, via links or other integrations, on or through third-party social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) or third-party social media plug-ins and applications. When you engage with our content on or through third party social networking sites or via third-party social media plug-ins and applications, you agree that by doing so, we will have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, email address, photo etc.) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application. When you provide personal information to us from your social media account, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with our privacy policy. In addition, when you provide personal information to us through an application or media plug-in on our Site or on social networking sites, other members of these sites may publicly view it and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties. For more information about how social networking sites handle your personal information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

We may also use the services of third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting, site analytics, and/or plug-in functionality. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. The use of technologies by these third parties, including, for example, social media plug-ins, are subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.

We reserve the right to send you email relating to your account status. This includes notices of credit-card problems and notifications about major changes to our Site and/or to our Privacy Policy.

WGBH, with the assistance from time to time of its third party service vendors, uses non-identifying aggregate information to analyze use of and better design the Site and to share with third parties in aggregate form only as appropriate. For example, we may tell a third party that a certain number of users accessed a particular video on our Site. However, we will not disclose any information that could be used to identify those users.

&lt;strong&gt;3. SECURITY OF INFORMATION&lt;/strong&gt;

WGBH has in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Credit card information provided on the Site, if any, is protected against unauthorized use by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security features. The SSL protocol is the industry standard method for creating an encrypted, secure connection between your web browser and a web server, such as the Site’s server. You should, however, keep in mind that no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Because most email is not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email.

&lt;strong&gt;4. CHILDREN’S GUIDELINES&lt;/strong&gt;

This Site is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect or store personally identifiable information about children under the age of 13. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has made a request for information, we will respond to the request and any identifying information will be deleted once we have responded. Similarly, if we become aware that a child under 13 posted identifiable information on any of our websites, we will also delete that information. We take children’s privacy very seriously and encourage parents to contact us with any questions or concerns they may have. Additionally, if parents want us to delete any collected personally identifiable information about their children under the age of 13, they can also contact us at the following website address: bostonlocaltv@wgbh.org.

&lt;strong&gt;5. CORRECTIONS TO PERSONAL DATA; OPTING OUT&lt;/strong&gt;

Please Contact Us to a) correct or update any personal information in the WGBH database that you state is erroneous, b) opt-out of future communications from WGBH, or c) request WGBH to make reasonable efforts to remove your personal information from the WGBH online database, thereby canceling your profile, newsletter registration and other WGBH registrations. This will not necessarily remove previous public comments and other User Materials submitted for public display on the Site. You should understand that it might be impossible to delete personal information entirely because of backups and records of deletions.

&lt;strong&gt;6. ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY FOR BOSTONLOCALTV.ORG&lt;/strong&gt;

By using this Site, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy for bostonlocaltv.org. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use this Site. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us.

&lt;strong&gt;7. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY&lt;/strong&gt;

Whenever this Privacy Policy for our Site changes, we will post the changes to the Site, and such changes will be effective immediately upon posting. If you do not agree to the changes, please do not continue to use the Site. Under certain circumstances, we may also elect to notify you of changes or updates to our Privacy Policy by additional means, such as posting a notice on the front page of our Site or sending you email if we have your email address.

i. A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber.

ii. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.

iii. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

iv. Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for Boston, Massachusetts for the resolution of any copyright or other claims arising out of your use of the Site or under the Terms, and a statement that you accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

  <member><name>description</name><value><string>Welcome to the Boston TV News Digital Library, funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Council on Library and Information Resources. This collaboration between the Boston Public Library, Cambridge Community television, Northeast Historic Film and WGBH Educational Foundation aims to bring to life local news stories produced in and about Boston from the early 1960’s to 2000.

We’ve created an online catalog of news content from Boston Public Library’s WHDH film collection (1960- mid-1970s), Cambridge Community Television (1988 to 1999), Northeast Historic Film’s WCVB film collection (1970-1979), and WGBH-produced The Reporters (1970-1973), Evening Compass (1973-1975) and the Ten O’Clock News. That's almost 50,000 records.

At the start of the project, we asked the public to browse our catalog and vote for the news content they were interested in seeing. Based on those votes and some input from scholars, we digitized over 500 film reels and tapes, which amounts to over 100 hours of historical news footage, which we have streaming for free. We'll be able to continue to digitize on-demand other news stories requested by our viewers, at the discretion of the holding institution.

PBS LearningMedia has created learning objects based on materials in the Boston TV News Digital Library. Check out this collection at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/collection/bln12/&quot;&gt;http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/collection/bln12/&lt;/a&gt;.

The project will also produce a primer on legal issues surrounding access to local news stories. We hope to launch the primer on the website in the near future.</string></value></member>
