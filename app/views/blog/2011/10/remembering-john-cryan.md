# Remembering John Cryan

Flipping through the Boston Globe last week, I was surprised to see a name I
couldn’t help but recognize. WCVB’s former cameraman, John Cryan, who worked
on many of the stories I am entering into our database, died a few weeks ago.
As his co-worker John Premack says in the
obituary:
<blockquote>Being in the right place at the right place at the right time is
rarely an accident. Jack had plenty of experience, and he was able to put
himself where the story
was.</blockquote>
Coming across someone I recognized from the Boston Local TV News Project
outside of work was a strange experience that has left me with a better sense
of just how connected this project is with our lives today and our
understanding of our very relevant
history.
