Library index cards, a number of intriguing subjects catch my eye. Usually it
is their brevity and lack of detail that draws my attention and makes me wish
I could watch the clip for myself there and then. This week, I came across a
couple of cards with the title, <strong>“Kids to
Cuba.”</strong>

Why are several hundred kids going up to Canada to take a boat to Cuba in
1970?

Thanks to the handy <a title="Boston Globe Archives"
href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/advancedsearch.html">Boston Globe
archives</a>, I was able to find
out.

According to the newspaper reports, 450 young Americans from all over the
country left Boston, disguised (unsuccessfully) as skiers, on chartered buses
for Canada. There they boarded planes for St. John and traveled on a cattle
freighter to Cuba, all on the Cuban government’s tab. Their mission in Cuba:
spend 10 weeks harvesting sugar with the other members of their 660-member
group, who arrived in Cuba via
Mexico.

<a href="http://www.venceremosbrigade.org/">“Venceremos Brigade.”</a>
Venceremos is a Cuban revolutionary slogan that means “We shall overcome” or
“We shall win.” These cane cutters aimed to help the Cuban people achieve
Castro’s goal of harvesting 10 million tons of sugar cane that year, a goal
which experts consider
impossible.

The Boston Globe also interviewed members of the 212 or 216 (depending on the
source) person brigade that went on a sugar cane harvesting trip the winter
before. These young “radicals” talk about wanting to see for themselves what
the revolution was all about and show solidarity with the Cubans by working
side by side with them and challenging the blockade. <a

writer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Kazin">Alfred Kazin</a>,
grew optimistic about the possibility of revolutions popping up in other
countries, because, “It’s just so obviously a better way to live, a better way
to organize society and to get people to relate to each
other.”

Formed in 1969, the “Venceremos Brigade” is still active today and recently
sent 33 members to Cuba in summer of 2010. It will be interesting to see this
1970 WHDH footage preserved and made available someday - were you part of the
brigade? What do you recall of your
experience?
