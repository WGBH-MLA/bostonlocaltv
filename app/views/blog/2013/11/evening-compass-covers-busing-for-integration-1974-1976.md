In 1974, federal judge <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Arthur_Garrity_Jr.">Arthur Garrity
Jr.</a> mandated a school busing plan with the goal of abolishing de facto
segregation of school children in Boston. What followed was one of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_busing_crisis">most heated
struggles</a> the city has seen in recent history. WGBH program Evening
Compass, a precursor to the Ten O'Clock News, developed a special ongoing
segment to cover the tensions, political actions, and social events related to
integration busing in the Boston area. WGBH reporters, including Ed
Baumeister, Pam Bullard, Paul deGive, Greg Pilkington, and Judy Stoia,
interview citizens and politicians in the studio and on location to portray a
street-level view of the
situation.

Evening Compass offers a relatable first-hand look into the social climate
that had the American public on edge for over a decade. Broadcasts include
daily statistical reports on school attendance and anecdotes of the violence
and fear that follow students as they acclimate to one of the largest changes
made to the educational system in the 20th century. Professionals,
politicians, and journalists are consulted to construct the story around the
clash of cultures and classes that transformed Boston into a battleground
during these years. Investigating cause and effect of events during this time
period is a pivotal part of understanding the culture of Boston and American
society at
large.

A broadcast from December 12, 1974—during year one, phase one of busing for
school integration—a crowd of 1,500 protesters takes a violent turn outside
South Boston High School. Students and parents express outrage, and WGBH
reporter Greg Pilkington asks some important questions about the unfolding
events. The story includes coverage of influential people such as NAACP Boston
president Thomas Atkins, anti-busing figurehead Louise Day Hicks, and urban
minority advocate Mel King, who calls the events of the day the "most bizarre
and diabolical set of circumstances [he had] ever seen." Have a look <a

coverage starts at the 4 minute
mark.
