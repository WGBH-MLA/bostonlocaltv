During the spring and summer of 1968, the <a
href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/freedomtrail/bostoncommon.asp">Common</a>,
Boston’s most famous public park in the <a
href="http://www.emeraldnecklace.org/">Emerald Necklace</a>, <strong>was
overrun by
hippies</strong>.

day, the nearly 50-acre park was inhabited by the more long-haired, bearded,
and beaded of Boston’s population. Local newspapers and media outlets referred
to it as “the summer of the hippie,” and it met little serious resistance from
local officials and community members for about two and a half months. But in
late June 1968, Boston <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_White_%28mayor%29">Mayor Kevin
White</a> <strong>issued a curfew on all loitering from 10pm-7am on the
Common</strong>, a move meant to address the increasing number of complaints
from local residents about the influx of young people living in the
park.

corner of Beacon and Charles Street</a>, which forms part of the Common’s
northwest border, became known as ‘Hippieville’ by local residents and shop
owners who, over the preceding summer months, had become incensed by the
crowd’s noise, waste, and perceived
irreverence.

width="264" height="180" /></a><strong>Despite the backlash, the hippies
remained.</strong> It was their right to stay some said, citing individual
human rights and Constitutionally protected freedoms. And stay they did,
setting up mini-farms and tent colonies throughout the Common as soon as the
weather turned nice. By the middle of June, 1968, hundreds of people had
descended on the public park and its surrounding area—genuine Earth-loving
hippies, teeny-boppers, suburban runaways, drug dealers, college kids on
break, ‘straight people’ (i.e., non-hippies), musicians, artists, all sorts of
characters. Looking to Mayor White, the local community began to push back.
Then City Councilor <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_F._Timilty_%28state_senator%29">Joseph
F. Timilty</a> gave an ultimatum in response: "Hippies are urinating,
defecating and fornicating in the Common. This must stop." Another city
official, an administrative aide to Mayor White by the name of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Frank">Barney Frank,</a> lamented
the distraction from more serious issues: “it’s a shame he [Mayor White] has
to waste so much of his time and political capital on these kids when there’s
so much to be done in this
city.”

The curfew went into effect on June 28, 1968 and was immediately met by a
peaceful 300-person candlelight parade through the Common. Bystanders were
encouraged to join. Unfortunately not all of the participants were interested
in peaceful protest, and by July 1, three days into the curfew, some 34 people
had been arrested for smashing windows, rioting, resisting arrest, and other
such
charges.

State Representative Charles Ianello (D-Roxbury, then 61 years old), who had
denounced the hippies as “parasites” and suggested they be run off the Common
using police dogs earlier in the week, was attacked and knocked down by some
20 protesters in his House Taxation Committee office in the <a
href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/freedomtrail/massachusettshouse.asp">State
House</a>. He was not hurt. Squads of about 75 policemen, accompanied by
police dogs and motorcycle units, appeared each night to clear the Common. <a
href="http://www.boston.com/globe">The Boston Globe</a> reported that nearly
2,000 people crowded the corner of Beacon and Charles streets to watch the
three-day spectacle. Over the following months, hundreds more would be
arrested for violating the curfew until its repeal by Suffolk Superior Court
in December 1968. A 12am curfew was instituted the following
summer.

What’s important to recognize is that a steady stream of young people coming
to Boston from California, New York, and neighboring states had cut the bona
fide hippie crowd with a large swath of ‘straight people’ beginning around
April 1968. These <strong>non-hippies were widely recognized as the real
troublemakers</strong> that summer. In fact, the majority of the more serious
arrests made after April 1, 1968—charges of narcotics, robbery, rape, and
violations of city and park laws—were reportedly committed by people who were
never members of the hippie
orthodoxy.

"They aren't the classy hippies, the beatniks or bohemians," Detective
Sergeant Richard Crowley was noted to have said—"many of them are just
criminal types." Police reported that only six of the 34 arrested during the
curfew riots were authentic hippies, and hippie leaders repeatedly urged
protesters to avoid confrontation and vacate before 10pm. Hippie leaders
claimed that it was members of the radical <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_a_Democratic_Society">Students
for a Democratic Society</a> (SDS) who were to blame for inciting aggressive
confrontation with
authorities.

Interestingly enough, a pretty vocal section of Boston state and civil society
was not initially opposed to the hippies, and in fact some went out of their
way to ‘help’ them. Mayor Kevin White formed a 15-person committee in June
1968 comprised of “businessmen, clerics, resident hips, police and
psychologists” to suggests ways in which the hippie community could be
remedied. Local churches and private homes provided safe places to sleep, the
<a

Clinic offered free medical attention and legal aid, and <a
href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/boardsandcommissions/PRC.asp">Boston Parks
Commissioner</a> John Warner donated 25 city lots to anyone who worked to
clear them of debris. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Bay_Fens">The
Fens</a>, another public park in Boston near the <a
href="http://www.mfa.org/">Museum of Fine Arts</a>, even gave hippies
squatting rights following their eviction from the
Common.

In a lot of ways, the June 1968 curfew and its subsequent controversy reads
like the most perfectly prototypical hippie-parent interaction: parents
renounce hippies for their drug use/unreserved views on sex and
love/disrespect for authority, while hippies renounce parents for their
close-mindedness/priggishness/thoughtless acquiescence to
authority.

Stereotypes and stereotypical characters abound in some of the Boston Globe
and <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/">Harvard Crimson</a> articles. Still,
there’s a whole lot of complexity behind the curfew of summer 1968 that’s
betrayed by chalking the whole thing up to a brawl between hippies and ‘The
Man’. It’s more than that. <strong>It’s a story about the role of individual
rights within a civil society, competing notions of civic duty and
expectation, and class.</strong> It’s also, perhaps above all, a story about a
specific youth subculture in Boston (see: “<a
href="http://www.orpheusreborn.com/BostonSound.html">Bosstown</a>”) at a time
when sub- and counter-cultural movements in general were entering the
mainstream national
culture.

Do any of you have recollections of the summer 1968
curfew?
What about the Boston hippie scene in the late
1960s?
