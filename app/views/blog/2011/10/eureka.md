# Eureka!

As you’ve seen from our intern posts, they've been pulling out interesting
stories as they have been transcribing news cards relating the BPL and NHF
collections. One of the big challenges of this project was to create
electronic records out of thousands and thousands of index cards that had been
created by the original news productions. As the cards were indexed by
subject, not number, we had no way of knowing if the cards matched the cans
until we had transcribed every single record. Well six months, and over 20,000
records, later we finished the BPL cards. The next stage was to take the
database to where the films were stored and check they matched
up.

As we pulled the first can out the box, I have to admit my fingers were
crossed. Whenever you take on an archival collection, it is always with a
slight trepidation you open up that first box. Would there be thirteen reels?
Would the first reel be “Julian Bond?” Would we really find “Meat packers and
sanitation?” I’m happy to say the answer was “yes!” There were small anomalies
in some records but on the whole the catalog is matching up to what we
expected it to be. So thank you to Allison, Barbara, Brian, Jake, Jared,
Jessica, Jon, Kenny, Laura, Robert and
Sadie.

Next steps -  putting the catalogs on the web. More
soon…
