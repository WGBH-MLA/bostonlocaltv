Abbie Hoffman was a social activist, who had already been arrest 41 times.  He
was known for his theatrical protests, once attempting, and claiming to have,
levitated the Pentagon. In 1968 he was prosecuted as one the the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_7">Chicago 7</a> on charges of
conspiracy to incite a riot. All charges were overturned in appeals. By the
mid '80s, Hoffman had already gone into hiding and resurfaced, returning to
his social activism, although finding the cultural climate very different from
the
'60s.

Amy Carter, daughter of former President <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_carter">Jimmy Carter</a>, grew up in
the White House, and was attending <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_university">Brown University</a> at
the time she participated in the CIA recruitment protest. This was her fourth
time being arrested, the other three times had been for protesting <a

In early April 1987 their case came to trial in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northhampton,_Massachusetts">Northampton,
MA</a> in front of a jury of 6, including two senior citizens. The prosecution
was confident, especially because they felt that the jury represented Middle
America, who they assumed would not be sympathetic to these
radicals.

The defense, led by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Weinglass">Leonard Weinglass</a>,
who had previously defended the Chicago 7, sought to convince the jury that
the misdemeanors committed by the protester were done to prevent a larger
crime being committed by the CIA. This is known as a necessity defense, which
considers an offense undertaken to prevent a worse crime, one that poses a
clear and immediate danger, is not considered illegal. Witnesses called by the
defense included Ralph McGehee, formerly of the CIA; <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Chamorro">Edgar Chamorro</a>, former
Contra leader; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg">Daniel
Ellsberg</a>, formerly of the Pentagon; and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_zinn">Howard Zinn</a>, professor of
history at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_university">Boston
University</a>. Their testimony exposed many questionable or outright illegal
CIA activities, including the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Indonesians,
Nicaraguans, and Vietnamese. (For a detailed description of the testimony
check out this <a
href="http://www.cia-on-campus.org/umass.edu/trial.html">article</a>.)

Amy's testimony was moving, arguing for the necessity of protest to achieve
productive change. She said, "Every time a person sacrifices himself for a
larger injustice, it aids in the cycle of
change."

On April<strong> </strong>15 1987 the jury acquitted the protesters of all
charges. By building such a strong case against the CIA, the defendants did
not only convince the jury that they should not be charged, but also brought
many of the CIA's wrongdoings to the public's attention and demonstrated that
Middle America was not going to give the CIA a free pass. One of the jurors, a
64 year old lady, said "A lot of us were not aware of what the CIA was into.
It was shocking and alarming, the things we heard from witnesses... These are
high, high caliber men, and I think their integrity struck the entire
jury."

The Carter family supported Amy through the trial and applauded her testimony
and the verdict. Former President Jimmy Carter said in an interview after the
trial that he was very proud of her and that "Amy is a very shy girl... but
she believes very strongly in what she's
doing."

Less than a month after the trial, the University of Massachusetts Amherst's
Faculty Senate voted to support a calls for open forums on campus with
agencies and employers, which prevented a ban on CIA recruiters on campus. The
school's policy did not change, but the public's knowledge about CIA practices
certainly
did.
