Every year on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._Day">Martin Luther
King Day</a>, the nation takes time to remember a great man, who helped change
the country. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.">Dr. King</a> was
completely dedicated to the peaceful protest against inequality, and the
United States has greatly benefited from his work and legacy as part of the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement">civil rights
movement</a>.

While many people remember distinctly his life and work, others might be too
young to have any first-hand experience. The Boston Local TV News Digital
Library has <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog?&amp;q=martin+luther+king&amp;search_field=all_fields&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">over
200 historic news stories</a> on King, which allow users to uniquely
experience the energy of the movement again through <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source">primary source</a>
footage.

When King was <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLK_assassination">assassinated</a> on
April 4, 1968, cities around America erupted in sadness and anger. Many of the
news stories in our collection depict Boston’s various reactions to King’s
death, including riots, speeches, prayer services, rallies, and fires. One of
these rallies, at Post Office Square, featured multiple speeches given by
Bostonians angered by his death and the continued inequality and
discrimination in America. PBS Learning Media used raw footage of that rally
to create a classroom resource for middle and high schoolers. Watch it <a
