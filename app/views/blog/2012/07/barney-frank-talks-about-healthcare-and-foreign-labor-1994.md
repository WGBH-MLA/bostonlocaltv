# Barney Frank talks about healthcare and foreign labor, 1994

In 1994, Massachusetts Congressman <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Frank">Barney Frank</a> addressed
the crowd at an event where various speakers talked about unemployment among
older workers. I watched CCTV's archive tape of this event, and a couple of
things he said seemed
prescient:

Frank said that one of the best ways to alleviate unemployment would be a
universal healthcare system, one that would supplement employer-connected
COBRA. And this universal system, he emphasized, shouldn't drop people for
preexisting conditions. He received a lot of applause for these remarks, but
he acknowledged that <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_reform">healthcare reform</a>
would face a lot of partisan opposition. Of course, it would take about 15
more years before the United States actually passed that kind of healthcare
legislation, and only after a lot of argument and compromise. It's only
recently been <a

by the Supreme Court</a>, but it's still a very partisan
issue.

Frank also mentioned a growing worldwide market for production and labor, a
new economy where anything could be produced anywhere. And he stated that he
wanted other nations to adopt working standards like those in the United
States: to set higher wage levels, to ban child labor. This is still a topic
of discussion today, as there's been a lot of press about how Apple products
are produced in Chinese factories, under allegedly negative conditions. In his
speech, though, Frank never mentioned China. When he spoke about other
nations, he meant Europe and Japan. Perhaps he didn't anticipate China's big
rise in the manufacturing
industry.
