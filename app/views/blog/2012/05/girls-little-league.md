Update: As of October 21, 2013 there is <a

post on our
website.

About a month ago I pulled a few stories from the WCVB collection to digitize.
One of those chosen was “Girl Little League Player” from May 24<sup>th</sup>,
1974.  The girl referred to in the <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/2012/03/slugs/">slug</a> is Janine Cinseruli, a
10-year old Peabody girl, who was heading into court the following day to
fight for the right for girls to play <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_League_Baseball">little league
baseball</a>.  The legal battle against Little League Baseball’s ban on girl
players began a couple years before in the spring of 1972 when Maria Pepe sued
for her right to play on the Little League team in Hoboken, New Jersey.  She
tried out, made the team, and played in three games before Little League
Headquarters learned about her inclusion on the team and threatened to pull
the their
charter.

Lawsuits popped up in several other states, including in Massachusetts where
two 10-year-old girls, Susan Wegryn of Wellesley and Janine, challenged the
Little League’s boy-only rule.  In April 1974 Judge Samuel Adams issued a
temporary restraining order that postponed tryouts until the issue was
resolved.  Janine was back in court in May, and in June she won her court case
and the right to play baseball for the Peabody
Braves.

Janine was a wonderful addition to the team and immediately silenced the
critics of girls joining the sport.  She won a starting pitcher position and
<em>The Journal </em>reported that in her first starting game she “struck out
16 batters and gave up only four hits.”  She was eventually promoted to team
captain and was the first girl to participate in the Little League major’s
All-Star
competition.

The WCVB story that I found in our vaults includes an interview with the
extremely well spoken 10-year old girl the day before her May court date. 
There are also interviews with boys from around the neighborhood who mostly
don’t mind a girl on the team as long as she is good, and the overwhelming
opinion seemed to be that Janine was better than any of
them.

Before stumbling across this story I had never thought about the fight for
girls to join little league.  I, like most girls my age, thought nothing of my
ability to play baseball as a child, and the brave young trailblazers less
than a decade earlier who made it possible.   I am extremely happy that this
footage is being preserved and can bring the story of this brave and talented
girl to a new generation of young
girls.
