href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Poetry_Month">National Poetry
Month</a> comes to a close, I decided to take a look and see if any poets were
featured in the WHDH collection. Though there were only a couple highlighted,
I did come across a card for <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Sarton">May Sarton</a>, a poet,
novelist, and historian who lived in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts">Cambridge</a> in
the early-to-mid 20<sup>th</sup>
century.

Sarton and her family arrived in Cambridge after escaping Belgium following
the German invasion in 1916. Her father, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sarton">George Sarton</a>, taught
the history of science at <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University">Harvard University</a>
for more than 30 years. During this time, May attended the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Rindge_and_Latin_School">High and
Latin School</a> in Cambridge and pursued a career in acting upon graduation.
By 1935, however, her acting aspirations ended and Sarton turned to writing,
which would become her lifelong
profession.

Sarton’s first book of poetry was published in 1937, when she was just 25
years old. A year later she published her first novel, <em>The Single
Hound</em>. By the time Sarton left Cambridge, in 1958, she had published five
books of poetry and eight novels. She moved north, to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson,_New_Hampshire">Nelson, NH</a>,
which inspired one of her greatest works, a memoir entitled <em>Plant Dreaming
Deep</em>. It was around the time of this publication (1968) that WHDH did a
profile on May Sarton. Just prior to this film, Sarton published a collection
of poetry entitled <em>As Does New Hampshire</em>. While the exact content of
the film remains to be seen, living in New Hampshire certainly played an
important role in Sarton’s life and may be discussed in the
profile.

Over the course of her lifetime, May Sarton published extensively, resulting
in a catalog of 16 books of poetry, 19 novels, and 12 journals/memoirs. Her
works covered a variety of topics, including feminism, sexuality, aging,
isolation, friendship, spirituality, and the struggles of creativity. Critics
have pointed to the sense of truth within her work and note the great effort
she made to be as open and transparent as
possible.

A celebration of May Sarton’s life and work will be held May 3-6 in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York,_Maine">York, ME</a> where Sarton
lived out the last 22 years of her life. The symposium, held on what would
have been her 100<sup>th</sup> birthday, will focus on Sarton’s influence as a
major literary and feminist voice of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century.

In honor of May Sarton, and to celebrate National Poetry Month, here is a <a

to one of her poems from around the time of the WHDH
profile.
