# To USE and Use For: The Art of Subject Authorization

By Laura
Hayner

There is a distinction thrown around in library school and, I’m sure, within
the library community on the whole--there are <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataloging">catalog(u)ers</a> and then
there’s everyone else. As a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> enthusiast, I guess
I pledge my allegiance to the former category, and so I was tasked with
conducting the initial authorization for the Boston TV News Digital Library
subject-heading
list.

I’m hip to the Library of Congress (LC) lingo and can navigate geographic
subdivisions as well as USE and UF (use for) pointers fairly well. Traveling
from unauthorized to authorized terms is kind of like <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_your_own_adventure">“Choose Your Own
Adventure,”</a> but for
nerds.

The creation of a robust, accessible, and searchable digital library has many
steps. In this blog, members of the Boston TV News Digital Library’s intern
army have <a href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/blog/tag/transcription/">described
the catalog card transcription process</a>, and Karen Colbron has also <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/blog/2011/10/eureka/">detailed the wonderful
moment</a> when it appeared that the card identifiers matched up to the film
reels. The most recent step has been to apply metadata, or descriptive
information, in the form of authorized subject terms to each card’s record in
the database. If you thought the cards’ contents weird, just wait until you
have to take all of those unique snowflakes and make them conform to LC
Authority
rules.

Why use authorized terms, you ask? Well, there are many reasons, some of which
I shall breeze through. They help point a variety of items to one access
point. They can make searching easier. Also, they just look
nice.

To start, I was given WGBH’s list of terms used for their Ten O’Clock News
project, as well as a general list of subject headings used by WHDH to index
its film footage, circa the 1960s and 70s. I was then charged with helping the
BPL librarians authorize the names, places, and topics therein. There are a
plethora of gateways to the LC’s authority rules and I used all of them; as an
example, WHDH’s <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis">‘Kennedy,
Jackie’</a> became LC’s ‘Onassis, Jacqueline Kennedy,
1929-1994.’

Once the initial list of authorized terms was created, interns then selected
terms from that list to add to each card’s record. Also, interns were invited
to suggest additional terms based on a card’s contents. This involved looking
up the authorized LC term and defending why it should be added based on the
card’s context, to be approved or rejected by BPL librarians. Adding
additional geographic locations, such as towns in Massachusetts, was
straightforward; adding additional subjects and names required more
work.

For example, recall Sadie Roosa’s post from July 29, 2011, <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/blog/2011/07/the-russians-are-coming-the-russians-are-coming/">“The
Russians are Coming! The Russians are Coming!”</a>. ‘Russians’ and ‘Soviets’
are interchangeable in these cards, as well as throughout the system. In
addition, the Ten O’Clock News subject list had the related terms ‘Russian
ships’ and ‘Russian sailors.’ Russians? Soviets? Which one should I
choose?

LC Subject Headings offer the following guidance. ‘Soviet Union’ should be
used for “subject headings beginning with or qualified by the word Soviet for
works on topics pertaining to the Soviet Union as a whole during the period
1917-1991.” So, the Soviets are coming! Thus, the authorized terms would be
‘Ships -- Soviet Union’ and ‘Sailors -- Soviet
Union.’

Name fragments on cards made it particularly difficult to assign an authorized
term. Many were abbreviated or lacked enough contextual information to
confidently apply a name heading. Two names that appeared frequently in
abbreviated forms were ‘Volpe’ and ‘Cushing.’ It didn’t take much additional
information to be reasonably sure that the cards are referring to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Volpe">John A. Volpe</a>, former
Governor of Massachusetts, and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cushing">Cardinal Richard
Cushing</a>, former Archbishop of Boston. However, for cards with more common
names or less information, the overarching rule for term application was when
in doubt, leave it blank. Harder to do than you might
think.

Intern postings have lamented the sparse and vague lines of catalog card
description. While those blog posts have shed light on some cards, hundreds
more lack enough information to confidently apply any subject terms without
additional research. How would you know to apply ‘Marijuana’ to the record for
<a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/blog/2011/12/the-mystery-of-the-kennedy-kids/">“Kennedy
Kids Busted”</a> without additional facts? Even with all of Jake Sadow’s
background research, there isn’t enough information to apply ‘Murder’ to the
card labeled <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/blog/2011/10/%E2%80%9Chi-dad%E2%80%9D/">“Tick
Tock Lane”</a>. Interns’ extra research using the card’s clues helped to
justify why we chose to add and apply certain terms. But, even then, we won’t
be sure we were right until we see the footage. As we work through our records
to thoughtfully apply authorized subject terms, it will continue to be
tricky.

As they say in the news business, stay
tuned!
