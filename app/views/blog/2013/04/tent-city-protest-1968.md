<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing">Affordable
housing</a> has always been an issue on Boston. Our collections have any
number of stories related to the topic, including protests, press conferences,
political campaign promises, and personal stories. It was exactly 45 years ago
today that one of the most unique and memorable protest occurred, led by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_King">Mel King</a>, in the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_End">South
End</a>.

In 1968 housing on the corner of Dartmouth and Columbus in the South End was
leveled. On April 25<sup>th</sup> of that year, Mel King and other community
activists held a sit-in at the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Redevelopment_Authority">Boston
Redevelopment Authority</a> (BRA) office to protest disregard of the
displacement of the residents during urban renewal. There they learned that
the Dartmouth and Columbus lot was being turned into a parking lot. So on
April 26<sup>th</sup>, another group, still led by Mel King, arrived at the
South End lot to protest the plan, arguing that the community would be better
served by the building of affordable housing than by a parking lot. The police
came, and, even though the officer in charge was sympathetic to the cause,
King and 28 other people were arrested for refusing to clear the area. They
were all released pretty much right
away.

On April 27<sup>th</sup>, an even larger group of people showed up at the lot.
They erected a grouping of shanties and tents, with a sign welcoming all to
“Tent City.” Some even set up hibachi grills, while other used string lights
to decorate. From the 27<sup>th</sup> through the 29<sup>th</sup> anywhere
from 100-400 protesters were occupying Tent City at any one time. To avoid
impropriety charges that might shut down the protest, only men slept in Tent
City.

The unusual nature of the protest gained a lot of local media attention, and
subsequent community sympathy. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Russell">Bill Russell</a>, the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_celtics">Celtic</a> player and
coach, provided food for the protesters from his South End restaurant, Slade.
Bishop Stokes, Head of the Episcopal Church in Massachusetts, donated money to
the cause. On April 30<sup>th</sup> police threatened to arrest anyone who
wouldn’t clear the area. The protesters decided that the three-day protest had
made their point, and so packed up and
left.

Although the protest ended in less than a week, the fight for affordable
housing in the South End continued. In 1969 the Tent City Task Force was
organized, and in 1979 that turned into the Tent City Corp. In 1984, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Flynn">Ray Flynn</a> became the mayor
of Boston, and his administrations supports a plan to turn the still vacant
Dartmouth and Columbus lot into affordable housing. Finally on April 30, 1988,
a new housing complex built on that lot, is dedicated and names “Tent City
Housing
Complex.”
