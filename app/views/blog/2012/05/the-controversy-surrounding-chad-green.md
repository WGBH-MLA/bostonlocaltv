# The Controversy Surrounding Chad Green

While working in the NHF database I came across quite a few records discussing
Chad Green from 1978-79.  Chad developed acute lymphocytic leukemia at age 2
and began chemotherapy treatment at the University of Nebraska Medical Center
in Omaha, where the family originally lived.  Chad's condition was improving
and his leukemia was in remission, but when doctors recommended radiation, the
Greens decided to move to Massachusetts, where Chad was placed in the care of
Dr. John Truman, a pediatric cancer specialist at Massachusetts General
Hospital.

Chad's parents wanted to try unconventional methods to fully treat the
disease, since the chemotherapy treatment was unpleasant for Chad.  One of
these methods was the medicine laetrile, a "metabolic therapy," which some
doctors claimed was an effective treatment for cancer.  The drug, made from
apricot pits, was thought by many people at the time to be a miracle cure for
cancer.  It has since been declared ineffective and potentially poisonous, and
has been outlawed in the United States.  However, the drug can still be bought
online or in other countries, most notably
Mexico.

When the Greens refused to resume chemotherapy, despite warnings from Dr.
Truman that Chad would die without it, a legal battle began.  Chad developed
signs of cyanide toxicity because of the treatment, which caused Massachusetts
authorities to declare him a ward of the court.  This meant that Chad's
parents received a court order to bring him back into the hospital to receive
chemotherapy treatment.  When the state denied the Greens request to
administer laetrile as well as chemotherapy, they fled to Mexico, where
doctors there continued to treat Chad with laetrile, a special diet, and
chemotherapy.

Authorities in Massachusetts issued the Greens a court order demanding them to
return Chad to Massachusetts for medical treatment, which they chose to
ignore.  The Supreme Court upheld the court order, though they also
acknowledged that parents have natural rights that include a private family
life, but stated that Chad's well-being was more important and that there was
strong medical evidence that the laetrile was not improving Chad's condition. 
The Greens still decided to stop the chemotherapy treatment again, believing
that God would cure Chad, and his leukemia returned.  Three months later, Chad
passed away and was buried in
Nebraska.

In 1980, the Greens returned to Massachusetts to turn themselves in to court. 
Once the judge heard their apologies for not abiding with the court's
authority, he found them guilty of criminal contempt but did not give the
couple fines or jail sentences, saying that the couple had suffered
enough.

What do you think of the Greens' decisions? Do you remember any other stories
involving laetrile as a cancer
treatment?
