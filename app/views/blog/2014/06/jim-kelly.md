Kelly</a> served in the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_City_Council">Boston City
Council</a> from 1984 until his death in 2007, representing District 2, which
covers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_boston">South Boston</a>,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_End,_Boston">South End</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Boston">Chinatown</a>. He
served as City Council president for six years, from 1994-2000. Before being
elected to City Council, he was the President of the South Boston Information
Center and a member of the South Boston Marshals, a paramilitary organization
active during the anti-busing
movement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this 1977 <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog/V_I50UWYXAOFZ5GSA ">interview</a> from
the Ten O’Clock News Collection, Gary Griffith asks Kelly questions about a
demonstration at Carson Beach, in his position as President of the South
Boston Information Center. The unedited field tape captures Kelly’s fervor,
which stirred his constituents enough to elect him to the City Council six
years later. The tape also includes all of the b-roll they shot of the South
Boston Information Center, which was presumably edited into the final news
story.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kelly also appears in many Boston news stories from the later 80s
and early 90s, especially from <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=james+kelly&amp;search_field=all_fields&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;range[year_i][begin]=1988&amp;range[year_i][end]=1988&amp;commit=Limit
">1988</a>, when he was fighting against forced public housing desegregation.
Several of these stories feature the same South Boston community meeting,
where Kelly argues with Mayor <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Flynn">Ray Flynn</a> about the
desegregation plan. Kelly is applauded by the South Boston audience, while
Flynn is booed and
heckled.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Despite the controversial positions Kelly took throughout the
years, he was undeniably a Boston icon. Most Boston City Council President
serve for one year, sometimes two. Kelly served for six
years.</p>
