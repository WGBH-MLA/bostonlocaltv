Now that we have started to digitized the reels that I have been looking at
for over a year, it is exciting to finally see what they are about.  One story
that was voted on was a couple reels with the slug “Dog Lady” or “Princeton
Dog Lady.” From looking at the story sheet it looked like this was just a
story about a woman who was hoarding animals in her house, but it turned out
to be something different and much more
interesting.

The “Dog Lady” that the slug refers to is Elaine Bosler, who was the appointed
dog officer for 6 years in Princeton Massachusetts.  As the town dog officer
she was supposed to destroy animals if they had not been adopted after 10
days.  Instead of killing the animals, however, she took them to her own house
and continued to work to place them with new owners.  She used her own money
to spay and neuter them and kept them at her personal residence until she
could find them a
new

home.  At the most she had 37 dogs and 24 cats living with her.  When new
neighbors moved in and complained to the town she was taken to court.  This is
the point in Elaine’s story, spring of 1977, where the WCVB stories take
place. She is interviewed at her home and before going into court, but
Elaine’s story did not end
there.

After a year of legal battles the judge told her that she could keep 10
animals, but the rest had to be destroyed.  Elaine found this to be
unacceptable so she asked for a two-month stay in order to sell her home and
move out of Princeton.  She found a bigger and much more rural house and moved
with all of the animals to Barre, MA.  She then started the Bosler Humane
Society in 1978.  This organization still exists today and remains the largest
no-kill shelter in New England.  By 1982 she had placed over 5,000 animals in
new homes, and by 2007 she had 10 paid employees and an annual budget of half
a million
dollars.

I am an animal lover, an adamant supporter of no-kill shelters, and have a dog
myself, so I was very moved by this story.  It is obvious when watching these
interviews with Elaine that she is a tenacious and compassionate woman, and
her actions have saved thousands of animals.  There are several videos on the
Bosler Humane Society website (<a
href="http://www.boslerhs.org/">http://www.boslerhs.org/</a>) of news stories
or interviews featuring Elaine.  After watching these videos and reading some
of the testimonials on the website I know that I am not the only person who
sees Elaine as a hero to dogs and cats all over New England.   I am very happy
that I ran across this story and can’t wait to see what other treasures are
unearthed as I continue to digitize this
material.
