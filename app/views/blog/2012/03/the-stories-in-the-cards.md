# The Stories in the Cards

By Brian
Shetler

As I’ve been working with the card catalog of WHDH film clips from the 1960s
and 1970s, I’ve come across a few interesting, wholly unintentional instances
where the text on the cards seem to have an artistic value of their own.
Similar to Félix Fénéon’s <em>Novels in Three Lines</em> or the <em>Six-Word
Memoirs</em> from <em>Smith Magazine</em>, these summaries not only provide a
glimpse into the real-life material in the films, they can also stand on their
own as (very) short
stories.

During the WHDH process, some of these brief, poetic moments will jump out at
me and provide a slightly different perspective on the card in question. These
unintended stories are sometimes odd, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but
always intriguing. Since I found them interesting, I thought it worth sharinga
few:
