The Boston Local TV News Project is humming along thanks to an army of interns
from the <a href="http://www.simmons.edu/gslis/">Simmons Graduate School of
Library and Information Science</a> and a great group of partners and
collaborators.

As of this posting, we have already said goodbye to one "batch" of interns and
currently have four more working on the project. Their main task right now is
to transcribe 30 drawers full of index cards which describe the <a
href="http://bostonpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1461045042_index_to_the_whdh-tv_news_film_archive">WHDH
collection</a> held by the Boston Public Library. Thanks to the Internet
Archive, images of the cards are now <a
href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22WHDH-TV+News+Film+Archive+%28Boston+Public+Library%29%22">available
online</a>. Of an estimated 30,000 index cards, they have made their way
through 9,000 already - which means we're almost 1/3 of the way done! Along
the way, they are stopping periodically to research some of the more
interesting or curious subject headings and finding great stories from our
local Boston history. These investigations result in regular postings on this
very blog.<!--more read

In addition to the intern work, Karen Colbron and Lindsay Whitacre from the
WGBH Media Library and Archives are working closely with <a
href="http://www.oldfilm.org/">Northeast Historic Film</a> to bring in the
assignment sheets from the <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/2011/06/06/processing-the-wcvb-collection/">WCVB
collection</a> for scanning and transcription. Unlike the subject oriented
WHDH card catalog - an attempt by someone at WHDH to organize the collection
for re-use - the WCVB "assignment sheets" are a bit more "raw" or "close to
the source." Assignment sheets were essentially logs written up by camera
staff, describing the footage they shot on a particular
day.

One of the challenges we face as a project is to bring all of these disparate
sources of data and description into one catalog. Each collection has
different <a
href="http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_A.aspx?#accesspoint">access
points</a> and levels of <a
href="http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_M.aspx?#metadata">metadata</a>. The
one thing most of them have in common are dates. Because the collections
overlap in dates, we expect to find that records from one collection inform
another and vice versa, allowing us to build a more robust catalog description
of a particular day and a particular news story across the four
collections.

Estimated date overlap across the four collections: <a
