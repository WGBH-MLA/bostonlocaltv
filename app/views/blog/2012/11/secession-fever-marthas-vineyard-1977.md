# Secession Fever: Martha’s Vineyard, 1977

I’ve recently started trying to be better about staying up to date on current
news, something I’ve let slip in the passed few years. I’ve been starting out
slowly, mainly browsing headlines and a few stories if the title grabs my
attention. As I was browsing the <a
href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">Huffington Post</a> a few days ago, my
attention was sucked out of my agape mouth, when I read “<a
href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/24/with-stickers-petition-secession-fever-texas_n_2184782.html">Secession
Fever Hits Texas</a>.” I’ve always known that Texans took pride in the fact
that they, along with Vermonters, have the right to secede built into their
state constitutions, but I never supposed it would be a strong enough
sentiment to be labeled a
“fever.”

I went on to read about other <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_partition_proposals">secession
petitions filed with the White House</a> by people from many states, which
reminded me of a story I’d worked with while cataloging the WCVB assignment
sheets. I went back through the catalog and found three separate news stories
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha%27s_Vineyard">Martha’s
Vineyard’s</a> 1977 attempt to
secede.

<strong>02/17/1977</strong>
<strong><em>Martha's
Vineyard</em></strong>
<em>They want to secede from the union? Shade of the Civil War, except the
civil war was not about redistricting, or was it. They claim they have no
representative in the legislature because of the redistricting.
</em>

<strong>03/02/1977</strong>
<strong><em>Vineyard
Flag</em></strong>
<em>The folks from Martha's Vineyard says they will secede from the Union
because they will soon have no representation due to redistricting. Now, they
have their own flag that they displayed to their current local
rep.</em>

<strong>03/22/1977
</strong>
<strong><em>Vineyard
Secedes</em></strong>
<em> Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket decide that because of the new
redistricting and they have no representation, they will secede from the
union.</em>

Basically it seems that there was redistricting, which lumped Martha’s
Vineyard and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantucket">Nantucket</a> in
with part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_cod">Cape Cod</a>,
which made the residents of the islands feel like they were not being
represented in the state government. They responded with local votes for
secession from the Commonwealth, and some reports also say from the Union;
thinking they might be the 51<sup>st</sup> state, a protectorate, or a
completely independent
nation.

The story made headline news nationally, and the proposed flag for their new
state/nation, a white seagull in a red circle on a blue background, became a
well-known image. Some of this national coverage can be <a
href="http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=492266">accessed</a> through
another News Archive, the Vanderbilt Television News Archive, although it is
not available for
streaming.

While most people have forgotten this event, the <a
href="http://www.mvmagazine.com/2007/september-october/secession.php">Martha’s
Vineyard Magazine</a> did a 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary piece on it in 2007.
They note in the story that even though the “revolution” is not remembered
with plaque or in museums, it is still remembered in the everyday lives of the
islanders, including their saying that they are “going to America” whenever
they take a trip
off-island.
