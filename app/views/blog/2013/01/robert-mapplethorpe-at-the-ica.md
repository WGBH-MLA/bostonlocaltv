Update: As of October 21, 2013 there is <a

related to this post on our
website.

If you’re the type of person who makes New Years resolutions, it’s possible
one of your 2013 goals is to go to more museums, or maybe to take better
advantage of the resources in the wonderful city you live in. If this is the
case (or even if it’s not), you should consider checking out the<a
href="http://www.icaboston.org/"> Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston</a>
(ICA). From now until March 3, 2013, they’re displaying <a
href="http://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/exhibit/this_will_have_been/">This
Will Have Been: Art, Love &amp; Politics in the 1980s</a>. One of the artists
featured in this show, is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mapplethorpe">Robert
Mapplethorpe</a>, a name that once caused a huge controversy in
Boston.

The WGBH Ten O’Clock News collection has many stories about the art of Robert
Mapplethorpe, who was a controversial and popular photographer in the 1980s.
We have 1989 footage of ICA director David Ross discussing that people think
Mapplethorpe’s work is controversial because of the erotic and gay subject
matter of his
photographs.

The majority of the records about Mapplethorpe are from the summer of 1990.
This is not surprising, considering the extent of the controversy that was
caused by the ICA exhibiting his <a
href="http://www.icaphila.org/exhibitions/mapplethorpe.php">The Perfect
Moment</a>, a traveling exhibition, which was curated by Janet Kardon. The
museum was charged with <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity">obscenity</a>. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_speech">Free speech</a> proponents
demonstrated in front of the museum. City councilman <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_O%27Neil">Albert “Dapper” O’Neil</a>
visited the museum to judge for himself, and thought the photographs were so
obscene that he threatened City Council action.  There is even footage of a
debate between the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_City_Council">City Council</a>, with
members defending both positions. Eventually the obscenity charges were
dropped, with the Massachusetts State government, ruling in favor of the
ICA.

The Ten O’Clock News also did an analysis piece, which compared contemporary
fashion and adverting photography to Mapplethorpe’s photography. Its points
out many similarities between the “controversial” photographs and “commercial”
advertising campaigns, and even uses clips from a Madonna music video,
Robocop, and Total
Recall.

Their coverage of this city-side controversy was extensive and comprehensive.
Based on the records, it seems like the amount of attention the exhibit got
because of the obscenity charges only made more people interested in visiting
the museum to see the work for themselves. Ten O’Clock News coverage of
protests outside the museum, also include footage of museum patrons exiting
the building, with mainly positive comments about the
show.

And as the icing on the cake, a year later in 1991, there is an interview with
opera singer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_sills">Beverly
Sills</a>, who mentions Mapplethorpe and the controversy, in her discussion of
discrimination in the arts, as well as
censorship.
