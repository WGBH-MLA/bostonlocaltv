website.

With the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012">election</a>
quickly approaching, I feel like I’m being flooded with talk of politics from
all sides. This has been huge topic on TV with news stories, campaign
speeches, and <a
href="http://www.2012presidentialelectionnews.com/2012-debate-schedule/2012-presidential-debate-schedule/">debates</a>,
as well as on the radio, my Facebook newsfeed, and here at work with <a
href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/choice-2012/">Frontline’s The
Choice 2012</a>. I started to feel almost bombarded when I started the section
of the Ten O’Clock News collection that I’m working on right now, which is 
intensive coverage of the <a

presidential
election</a>,

following the primaries and general elections. This election involved a lot of
prominent figures. Some of the highlights from the primaries
include:

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_gore">Al Gore</a> campaigning at
Brandies and giving up in Iowa to concentrate on New Hampshire Primary and
Super
Tuesday.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_biden">Joe Biden</a> campaigning
throughout
Massachusetts.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_dole">Bob Dole</a> supporting INF
treaty and being criticized for his sharp humor coming across as just being
mean.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_jackson">Jesse Jackson</a>
campaigning in Boston and New Hampshire and an analysis of Jackson's dynamic
oratory.

and, of course, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bush_Sr.">George
Bush</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dukakis">Michael
Dukakis</a>. I attribute the massive amount of Ten O’Clock News coverage of
this election (over <strong>260</strong> stories!) mainly to the fact that
Massachusetts’ very own governor, Michael Dukakis, was named the Democratic
Party’s presidential
nominee.

Besides in depth coverage campaigns and of each candidate’s views on labor,
foreign policy, environmental protection, the economy, and more, the Ten
O’Clock News collection includes less policy-based stories as well. These
include multiple stories covering the scandal where <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sasso">John Sasso</a>, Dukakis’
campaign manager, leaked a video showing Joe Biden, who was also running for
the Democratic nomination, giving a speech very similar to a British
politician. This scandal essentially ended Biden’s campaign, and temporarily
ended Sasso’s position in the Dukakis campaign as well. Sasso resigned;
however, he was hired back on very late in the election, when Dukakis was
slipping.

Working with this section of the collection at the same time as another
important election is going on around me, I’m really interested to see what
this coverage was like. I wonder how much of a difference there is between
today’s political coverage, and coverage from less than 25 years ago. I’d also
be excited to see some of these politicians, who went on to serve prominent
roles, so much earlier in their
careers.

The Boston Local TV News Digital Library also has coverage of other
Presidential elections between 1960 and 2000.  Another great resource for
those of us interested in Presidential debates is this Dartmouth <a
