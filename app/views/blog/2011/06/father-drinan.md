Hello, I am a new intern here working on the Boston Local TV News Project and
this is my first post. I am just getting acclimated to my new work environment
with new responsibilities and tasks. I haven’t yet met the auspicious goal of
transcribing 200 WHDH cards in a single day, but I’m working on it. I’ve begun
by working my way through the cards for news stories beginning with the letter
D. There have been stories about “Dope Raids”, “Double Parking” and the town
of <a href="http://www.doverma.org/">“Dover”</a> among a host of other stories
beginning with
D.

come across is the name <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Drinan">Robert Drinan</a>, or as he
was also known as evidenced by the story cards, “Father Drinan.” <!--more read

I could not place it exactly. His more public years occurred while I was still
a small child. However, after some research I found out that Robert Drinan, a
Catholic priest, was an accomplished man of notoriety and some controversy. He
may be one of a very few Catholic priests on record to support abortion
rights. Drinan made his argument on legal
grounds.

In 1970 “Father Drinan” ran for the U. S. House of Representatives as a
Democrat defeating longtime incumbent and vice chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, Representative Philip J. Philbin. He also defeated
Republican opponent John A. S. McGlennon. Father Drinan ran as an anti-war
candidate strongly opposing U.S. involvement in Vietnam. While <a

Congress</a>, Drinan took on other human rights issues such as emigration
rights of Soviet Jews to Israel and the civil war in El Salvador. He also
filed the first resolution to impeach then President Nixon on grounds of
illegal bombing of Cambodia. Of course, President Nixon would later resign due
to the Watergate
scandal.

Representatives[/caption]

Being one of only two Catholic priests to ever serve in Congress, he held
office as a U.S. Representative for Massachusetts for ten years from 1971
until 1981. It was only after an imminent ultimatum from Pope John Paul II
requiring him to choose between the Congress and the Church that would he step
down to resume his academic career within the
Priesthood.

In addition to serving in Congress Drinan was a scholar earning a BA and an MA
from Boston College, law degrees from Georgetown University, a theology
doctorate from Gregorian University in Rome and many honorary degrees. Drinan
began his academic career as Assistant Dean at the <a
href="http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/">Boston College Law School</a> and would
later become its dean by the age of 36. Drinan is credited with improving and
building the reputation for the BC Law School. Robert Drinan also authored
multiple books and articles. After his time in Congress, Drinan taught law at
Georgetown Law until his death in
2007.
