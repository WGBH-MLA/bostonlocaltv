Recently I was fortunate enough to talk with former Ten O'Clock News reporter
John Hashimoto. He answered some of my questions about his work on the TOCN
and changes in the news industry since the early
1990s.

John is currently the Senior Director of Product Management at CNN Digital in
Atlanta.

<strong>Sadie Roosa:</strong> How long did you work on the Ten O'Clock
News?

<strong>John Hashimoto:</strong> From 1990-1991. I believe I was the last
reporter hired by TOCN before its unfortunate cancellation after 15 years on
the
air.

<strong>SR:</strong> How did working on TOCN compare to other news reporting
you did before or have done
after?

<strong>JH:</strong> By the time I joined WGBH as a cub on-air reporter I had
already spent nearly a decade in local TV news -- but behind the camera. I
produced newscasts and field reports in San Diego, Los Angeles and at WNEV-TV
(now WHDH-TV) in Boston before joining TOCN as a general assignment -- and
very unpolished --
reporter.

As you might expect, The Ten O'Clock News was unlike any local TV news
operation I had experienced. The newsroom was small (maybe 10 desks in a
cramped room), the equipment dated and the atmosphere decidedly quaint
compared to the "Action News" world I left
behind.

But what TOCN lacked in sizzle it more than made up for in substance. Under
the leadership of Chris Lydon and John VanScoyoc, TOCN reporters (including
already well-established "stars" such as David Boeri and Christy George) were
encouraged to dig deeper -- and go longer -- on truly local and regional
stories that many TV news executives had forsaken: education, local business,
community affairs and the
arts.

While other stations "covered" Boston in 90-second stories, our nightly
reports sometimes ran six to eight minutes in length -- interminable by TV
news standards. For me, it was liberating -- and occasionally
daunting.

<strong>SR:</strong> Take me through the process of creating a story for the
air. What was your favorite part of that
process?

<strong>JH:</strong> The mechanics of TV news reporting at the time were
universal -- and I'm sure the process fundamentally remains the same. The
assignment desk hands you a story, you make calls to firm up interviews, you
jump in the van with the camera crew, you spend half the day in the "field"
shooting your story, you return to the station to write and voice track your
script, you work with a video editor to weave it all together into a coherent,
if not concise
story.

The hardest part of the process for me: taping a standup. Multiple and
increasingly frustrating retakes were the norm. I was never a natural on
camera and it showed in every conceivable
way.

My favorite part: Working with video editors to put it all together. Video
editors, like their brethren in the film world, are the master chefs of
television news -- able to turn mash into a fine meal. Two of TOCN's best
editors, the husband-and-wife team of Damon Meharg and Linda Saether, later
had illustrious, award-winning careers at CNN in Atlanta where I reunited with
them in the
1990s.

<strong>SR:</strong> Can you comment on the changes in technology used for
news reporting from the time of TOCN to the
present?

<strong>JH:</strong> Like all media, the transition from analog to digital has
had a profound impact on TV news. The cameras are tiny (soon enough, to be
replaced by Google Glass, it would seem), tape has been discarded in favor of
discs and cards and editing is now non-linear. The classic scene of a TV crew
-- reporter, photographer and audio tech with boom mike -- arriving on the
scene in a van now seems almost Industrial Age. The fact is: Anderson Cooper
can do everything with a smart
phone.

Just as dramatically is the rise of online and mobile media. Imagine how
different TOCN would have been with a website and app, where brilliant writing
by Chris Lydon, Carmen Fields and Hope Kelly would have added yet more
dimension and depth to TOCN's unique local
coverage.

<strong>SR:</strong> Do you remember any particularly good/funny/interesting
"around the office"
stories?

<strong>JH:</strong> You don't spend time under the tutelage of a Christopher
Lydon without colorful front page-like memories. It was not quite William
Shawn's New Yorker, but Chris imbued our newsroom with a combination of Yankee
high-mindedness and intellectual vigor, along with a dose of South Boston
combativeness

That's not to say TOCN was without humor. Reporter Marcus Jones and his
wonderfully nerdy passions alone ensured a good measure of daily
levity.

But unlike any other TV newsroom I had worked in, TOCN was a place where
reporting and writing were foundational. The fact that WGBH could never afford
a satellite truck was probably a blessing. It kept us focused on
story-telling, not
performance.

<strong>SR:</strong> What is your favorite story you worked on, or the one of
which you are the
proudest?

<strong>JH:</strong> The story of which I was most proud was, in fact,
somewhat international in scope. But this only underscores how different --
and independent -- TOCN was from the media
mainstream.

At the height of the Gulf War in 1991, the U.S. deployed Patriot missiles --
built by contractor Raytheon in Massachusetts -- to intercept Scud attacks
launched at Israel by Saddam Hussein. At that early point in the conflict, the
success of the Patriot defense was barely questioned by the mainstream U.S.
media. I was assigned to interview experts at MIT and Harvard who raised
concerns that the Patriots were causing more damage from explosive debris than
if the system had never been
deployed.

The <a href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog/V_S7G4JWGGAOW2W0N">story</a>
aired months before the efficacy of the Patriot was questioned during formal
congressional testimony, challenging Bush Administration claims that the
missle was a successful demonstration of anti-missle
defense.

As the second Iraq conflict proved, media skepticism about U.S. defense
strategy is rare in the fog of war. This is especially true if you work in a
local TV station, where commercial interests are paramount. TOCN was that rare
place where television journalism could be pursued (carefully, mind you)
without fear or
favor.
