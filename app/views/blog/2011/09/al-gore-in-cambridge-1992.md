Update: As of October 21, 2013 there is <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog/4958">video </a>related to this post on
our
website.

In 1992, Senator and Vice Presidential candidate Al Gore visited the offices
of Thinking Machines, which was a Cambridge-based manufacturer of
supercomputers. Cambridge Community Television was there to cover his visit,
and I recently watched our
tape.

Thinking Machines eventually went out of business and closed in
1994.

Meanwhile, Al Gore went on to serve two terms as Vice President, lose his own
Presidential election (to a son of the man he'd helped defeat eight years
earlier), receive a Nobel Peace Prize for his environmental activism, and, of
special interest to those of us who are in media production, co-found Current
TV.

But back in 1992 he was just an up-and-coming Vice Presidential candidate
whose team would have to unseat the current President, which wasn't quite a
foregone conclusion at that time. It was very possible that he would lose,
maybe go back to Congress, and retire quietly someday. I don't think anybody
then would have predicted the eventual height of his fame. So watching this 19
years later, knowing what would happen, was very
interesting.

He spoke briefly about the Internet and the upcoming global environmental
crisis, both topics for which he became well-known and that are a huge part of
public policy today. But they were just starting to really enter the
mainstream back
then.

However, one thing he didn't mention was domestic terrorism, which, as the
10th anniversary of 9/11 has reminded us, is a very real threat. But the first
World Trade Center attack wouldn't happen until 1993, so the United States had
no experience with that kind of thing
then.

It just goes to show that sometimes you can predict what's going to be
relevant in the next decade, but other times, you
can't.
