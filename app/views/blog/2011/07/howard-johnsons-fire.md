# Howard Johnson's Fire

I have reached the end of my internship here at the Media Library and Archive
at WGBH, but the work continues with the Boston Local TV News project.  There
is still so much to do.  I’m excited to see where the project will go and all
the valuable news footage that will be preserved and
archived.

Since starting the project back in May, I have transcribed approximately 2000
cards.  So many names and events from the late sixties and early seventies
have gone across my computer screen prompting me to find out more.  The
experience has given me a deeper understanding of that time period. For my
last entry into the blog, I’d like to highlight a card I came across that,
while tragic, also reminded me of
summer.

The day was June 10,
1969.

The card reads that a <strong>fire destroyed the site of the first Howard
Johnson’s
restaurant</strong>.

A story the next day from the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald#The_Boston_Herald-Traveler">Herald
Traveler</a> newspaper, a predecessor to the current <a
href="http://www.bostonherald.com/">Boston Herald</a> newspaper, explains, “ A
three-alarm fire in Quincy yesterday destroyed the building that had been the
first ice cream parlor of the multimillion dollar Howard Johnson’s restaurant
chain.”  The article goes on to say that Howard Johnson’s had not occupied the
building for quite some time and that another restaurant, Bee-Dees, was the
last recent tenant. Ironically the building was scheduled to be demolished
within days of the fire to make way for the <a

MBTA</a> railroad station and parking
lot.

Of course, building fires do not conjure up visions of summer, but Howard
Johnson’s reminds me of <strong>travel</strong> and <strong>ice
cream</strong>, two summer-time favorites.  The once familiar orange-roofed
motor lodges and restaurants complete with ice cream parlors were the refuge
for weary summer travelers.  I’m not sure how many original orange- roofed
Howard Johnson’s restaurants and/or motels are left, but if you were around
before the mid 1980s you most likely remember
them.

The motor lodges are now owned by the Wyndham Hotel Group which still
maintains the “Howard Johnson” brand.  You can take a trip down memory lane or
discover what these iconic places used to look like at this <a

restaurants and motels of days
past.

Do you remember the first
Ho-Jo's?
