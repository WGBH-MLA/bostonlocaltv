# James Bond Riot

While I have researched many demonstrations, rallies, sit-in, and riots in my
time working on the Boston TV News Digital Library, the “James Bond Riot” of
1967 was the most puzzling event I came across, and one of the most rewarding
to research. My research began with the book, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/When-Boston-Time-Line-Almanac/dp/1555536204/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359987144&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=when+in+boston"><em>When
in Boston</em></a> by Jim Vrabel, the most authoritative source I could find
referencing the riot. Only through more unlikely sources, like obituaries, was
I able to uncover all of the intriguing
story.

In 1967 the James Bond spoof, <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061452/"><em>Casino Royale</em></a>, was
released. John Markle, the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>
Boston publicist had a “brilliant” idea for the movie launch. Why not let
anyone who showed up to the 2 a.m. premiere at the Savoy Theater wearing a
<strong>trench coat</strong> in for free? The offer was broadcast over Boston
radio and heard by many people. What Markle didn’t take into account was that
the May 6<sup>th</sup> premiere date was right in the middle of the pre-exam
reading period at all of the Boston/Cambridge colleges. Those tens of
thousands of students had nothing to do (or at least a much more flexible
schedule than usual), and so <strong>over 15,000</strong> trench-coat-wearing
students showed up at the Savoy. With so many people and obviously not enough
room in the theater for all of them, a riot broke
out.

Don’t take the fact that this film incited a riot to mean that this is one of
the best films ever. It seems like bored students with the option of free
movie tickets is more to blame. Even though the film ended up being pretty
successful at the box office (the James Bond brand can do that), it was not
very well received critically; many thinking it was disorganized and
indulgent.
