Update: As of October 21, 2013 there is <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog?f[subject_s][]=Poetry">video</a>
related to this post on our
website.

In our age of the Internet and instant gratification, we can pretty much just
go to youtube, search for our favorite authors, and be rewarded with a video
(of varying quality, granted) of said author reading their work. This is
wonderful!

However, before youtube and the Internet people had to actually go to
whichever bookstore or library the author was reading at, sit in uncomfortable
folding chairs packed too closely into the small floor space, and strain to
hear the author’s recitation. Not that author-readings weren’t, and still
aren’t, wonderfully intimate gatherings that are rewarding in their own right,
but what if you couldn’t make it to the reading? Well, they used to broadcast
these readings on TV, so you could enjoy the sound of writers reading their
own words from the comfort of your living
room.

In the Boston TV News Digital Library, we have many readings by nationally
recognized and local writers, preserved on tape or film, and with your help we
can choose which ones we’d like to digitize and stream online, so everyone may
once again enjoy these readings from their living rooms (or wherever you can
get an Internet connection,
really).

Here is a sampling of the authors of whom we have footage at
readings:

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Brutus">Dennis Brutus</a> was a
South African activist and poet, who was arrested and jailed in the cell next
to Nelson Mandela. In 2008 the South African Department of Arts and Culture
awarded him a Lifetime Honorary
Award.

Irish poet who used to teach at Harvard. In 1995 he won the Nobel Prize in
Literature.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Hall">Donald Hall</a> is an
American poet and writer, as well as a respected academic who has taught at
Stanford University, Bennington College, and the University of Michigan. In
2006 he was appointed as the Poet Laureate of the United
States.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Walcott">Derek Walcott</a> is a
Saint Lucian poet and playwright, who currently teaches poetry at the
University of Essex. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992, and

2011.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Espada">Martin Espada</a> is a
Latino poet, who teaches poetry at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
He was appointed the Poet Laureate of the Northampton, MA in 2001, and
received the National Hispanic Cultural Center Literary Award in 2008 and the
Massachusetts Book Award in
2012.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_Gordimer">Nadine Gordimer</a> is
a South African writer and political activist. She received the Nobel Prize in
Literature in
1991.

There are several readings from various programs encouraging prisoners to
write and share their own
poetry.

In 1988 four Vietnam veterans came together to read their poetry reflecting on
the
war.

AND as a special treat, I found a slightly mysterious record description which
read:

<strong><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Murray">Bill
Murray</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_reeve">Christopher Reeve</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockard_Channing">Stockard Channing</a>
and other celebrities assemble at Sanders Theater for a poetry reading.
 </em></strong>

I didn’t think that all of these celebrities had written poetry of their own,
and I wondered why they would all have assembled for a reading, when none of
them are known for poetry at all. I finally tracked down <a
href="http://people.brandeis.edu/~teuber/ptprods.html">an events calendar </a>
for the Poets’ Theatre Productions from 1987-1994, which included an event
called “In the Company of Poets: A William Alfred Anthology.” This was an
evening of celebrating poetry selected by William Alfred, from his recently
release anthology titled “In the Company of Poets,” and read by various
celebrities. Read a <a

of the event from the Harvard
Crimson.
