## Introduction and Installation Instructions

### Use RVM in development (for your own sanity)

This isnâ€™t absolutely required, but working without RVM makes life really difficult.

See https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/ for instructions on installing and running RVM.

You probably want to use Ruby 1.9.3 with this application.

```sh
$ gem install bundler
```

### Getting the application

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/WGBH/bostonlocaltv.git
$ cd bostonlocaltv
$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate
$ rails s
```
