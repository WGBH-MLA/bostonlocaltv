# Reconstructing Contexts through Local TV News Project

By Sadie
Roosa

Having just moved to Boston at the beginning of this summer, working on the
Local News Project has been a mini course in local history. The best part
about it is that it’s a sort of living history because I don’t just read about
events that happened a long time ago, I read about reports that were filmed
and aired as these things were happening. I can’t wait until we begin
digitizing some of them to put
online.

A story I am really interested in, which I had never read about, is the
Women’s Lib takeover of a Harvard University building. This is an important
piece of both local and women’s studies history, which I am sure many people
more familiar with these fields are familiar with. And maybe I would have come
across this information in my reading at some other point. But there is
something wonderful about learning about this event in as close to its
original context as I’m going to get. When I read about this story it was not
in a women’s studies textbook, where it would be considered a stepping stone
in a larger movement. Nor was it on a tour of Harvard’s campus, where it would
be presented as one of many historic events to take place in the area. Instead
I learned about this exciting happening as one of thousands of news stories
taking place in a short number of
years.

When you experience history as it happens you don’t see it as part of the
larger arc of a movement, but rather as one exciting thing, which may or may
not relate to other exciting things. When you experience history this way, you
don’t know just based on the fact that its being reported in a textbook that
it is extremely significant. You don’t even know how the whole thing is going
to turn out. That’s the way we, working on this project, are experiencing this
period of Boston history. And as someone who is not particularly familiar with
the area or local history, I really feel like I’m absorbing these stories the
way people watching them be originally broadcast
did.
