# Mohoney Trial

By Karin

While going through the WCVB news film cans I came across several with a note
taped to the lid that said “Mahoney film held by court 4/7/77.”  After running
across this a few times I began to wonder what the Mahoney trial was and why
the court might have held the film.  With my interest peaked, I dug a little
deeper and found out what the Mahoney trial was
about.

On New Years Eve 1975 Maureen Mahoney arrived at her home in Tewksbury to find
her mother, father, and 15-year-old brother had been murdered.  Dr. Hugh
Mahoney had been a well-respected member of the community and as an
obstetrician had delivered many of the neighborhood children.  The community
was shocked by this senseless, and seemingly motiveless murder.  Several
months later the case remained unsolved and police feared they may not find
the killer.  Then a lucky break occurred when Donald Wilson, in custody of the
New Hampshire police on unrelated charges, began to talk about the
murders.

On the night of the murders, four men had gone into the Mahoney home with the
intention of robbing a wall safe.  Donald Wilson was the driver, and therefore
did not enter the house or participate in the murders.  His brother Robert
Wilson entered the house along with Robert Smith and Terence Milan.  The
robbery went wrong from the beginning and the burglars shot and killed the
family.  Donald Wilson testified against the rest and went into witness
protection after the trial.  Milan was also a witness for the prosecution and
as a result was granted immunity for his part in the murders.  He still went
to jail, however, for his part in another murder that the gang had committed. 
Robert Smith and Robert Wilson were both convicted and sent to prison.  Milan
was released in 2003, Smith died in 1988, and Wilson is still serving his
sentence.

This gang was part of the “Troy Boys,” a gang from Troy, New Hampshire that
was basically dispersed after this trial.  I did not find any information on
why the film might have been held by the court, but I did find a few other
reels that relate to this trial that were not seized and look forward to
watching
them.

Did you live in Tweksbury at this time?  Do you remember these murders?  Or
were you in the Troy area in the mid-1970’s when the Troy Boys were
active?
