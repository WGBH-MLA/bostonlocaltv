# Resources for Scholars

This project is a collaborative community effort to bring together historical
local TV news collections in a central, accessible, online environment. We
hope that researchers will find our content engaging and useful for work in
their fields of study. For more on the scholarly applications of our
collections, read this <a

We're very excited to offer a remarkable feature that allows users to access
any item in our catalog. Through our Digitization on Demand program you can
select any artifact from our catalog of over 50,000 items, and help save a
piece of local history by sponsoring its preservation. It's easy. If you come
across an items that you're excited to see digitized and preserved, all you
have to do is request it. We'll contact you about the costs of digitization,
and soon the video will be streaming on our site for free public access. Read
