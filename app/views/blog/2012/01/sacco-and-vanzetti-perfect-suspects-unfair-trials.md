# Sacco and Vanzetti: Perfect Suspects, Unfair Trials?

During my first weeks at WGBH working on the Local News Project, I have found
many interesting pieces of information that only hint at larger stories. One
of these referred to the Sacco/Vanzetti Memorial. I love history, but I was
unaware of this particular story. I am glad that I found
it.

From the WCVB’s assignment
sheets:
Item: Sacco/Vanzetti
Memorial
Description: The gov. announces a memorial and also acknowledges, on behalf of
the state, for the first time, that s &amp; v may not have gotten the fairest
shake in the
trial.

On May 5th, 1920, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacco_and_Vanzetti">Ferdinando Nicola Sacco
and Bartolomeo Vanzetti</a> were arrested for murder and robbery. Two men
transporting company payroll were murdered in Braintree, MA on April 15, 1920,
and Sacco and Vanzetti looked like perfect suspects. They were Italian
immigrants and radical militant anarchists, and feelings were charged in the
community toward these
groups.

There were two trials, the first for Vanzetti for robbery. The defending
attorney did not do everything he could have to help his client, and Vanzetti
was convicted. A few years after the trial the defending attorney joined the
law firm of the prosecuting
attorney.

At the second trial Sacco and Vanzetti were tried for the two murders. “Solid”
evidence against them actually did not single them out as the murderers, but
was considered to. Witness testimony was ignored. They were found guilty even
though another man, Celestino Maderios confessed to the
murders.

Sacco and Vanzetti received the death penalty and were executed by electric
chair, August 23,
1927.

In 1977, Governor Michael Dukakis declared August 23, 1977, the 50th
anniversary of their execution to be Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti
Memorial Day.  He had requested a study of the original trial and the evidence
that had come to light since then. He saw a lack of due process in their
trials, and wanted to right that
wrong.

Sacco and Vanzetti continue to be remembered in rallies, commemorations and
memorials. Do you think that they were guilty or innocent? Have you seen or
participated in any events commemorating
them?
