truck that was on its way to deliver a shipment to the <a
href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=federal+reserve+boston&amp;ll=42.352756,-71.05382&amp;spn=0.01064,0.022724&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=federal+reserve&amp;hnear=0x89e3652d0d3d311b:0x787cbf240162e8a0,Boston,+MA&amp;cid=0,0,496396189635343269&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;iwloc=A">Federal
Reserve Bank in
Boston</a>.

The delivery consisted of bags and pouches containing more than $1.5 million
in cash. Armed with shotguns and aided by accomplices who were diverting
traffic away from the robbery, <strong>the thieves got away with all of the
cash. The money has never been found</strong>.<sup>1</sup> Nearly five years
after the robbery the FBI and US Postal Inspectors had still not pegged anyone
for the robbery. With the statute of limitations approaching, the Justice
Department stepped up their investigation and, in November 1967, two indicted
suspects were brought into
court.

The trial was a sensation, with the defense counsel, led by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Lee_Bailey">F. Lee Bailey</a>, not
calling a single witness in their case.<sup>2</sup> The two defendants were
quite a strange pair. John J. Kelley was a middle-aged career criminal with a
history of armed robbery while Patricia Diaferio was a young mother of four
who was described as a “beautiful” and “big-bosomed blonde” by witnesses and
who referred to her lawyer as “a doll.”<sup>3</sup> One witness, however,
conceded that he might have been mistaken about identifying Mrs. Diaferio by
her bust size. Diaferio’s lawyer had his client wear a tight sweater and stand
sideways in front of the witness to bring into doubt his claim that she was
the big-bosomed woman at the crime
scene.<sup>4</sup>

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the case, however, wasn’t who was in
the courtroom, but rather who was <em>not</em> there. Thomas R. Richards, a
third suspect, disappeared five days before the trial began. Prior to trial,
Richards had cooperated with inspectors and admitted his involvement in the
heist. He even agreed to testify against his cohorts. When he disappeared,
along with his testimony, prosecutors did not have enough evidence to produce
a conviction of the two other defendants.<sup>5</sup> It took the jury only an
hour of deliberation to acquit Kelley and
Diaferio.<sup>6</sup>

During the lead-up to the trial WHDH filmed a piece on Thomas Richards that
aired on the 5th anniversary of the robbery in 1967. The piece may be one of
the last depictions of Richards before his disappearance. The other footage
that WHDH has concerning Thomas Richards comes from January 1968, two months
after his disappearance. That footage is particularly intriguing since it is
described as being shot at a <a
href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=holiday+inn+dedham+ma&amp;ll=42.232489,-71.182737&amp;spn=0.010661,0.022724&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=holiday+inn&amp;hnear=0x89e37f8dfcc2125b:0x71187cf872e52e0,Dedham,+MA&amp;cid=0,0,1076426828622468638&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;iwloc=A">Holiday
Inn near Dedham, MA</a>. According to reports, Richards’ car was found in the
Holiday Inn parking lot and was perhaps one of the last locations where Thomas
Richards was seen
alive.<sup>7</sup>

<strong>After this, the trail of his disappearance went dead
cold.</strong>

width="316" height="190" /></a>The footage in the WHDH archive might provide
insight into the days before and after Thomas Richards’ disappearance. In
addition, the availability of the WHDH footage through the Boston Local TV
News Projects’s online archive might spark new interest in the case and begin
anew the search for the missing man and the money. Investigators in 1962
believed that “a million dollars…[was] somewhere on the Richards premises” and
even went so far as to dig up a concrete patio in Richards’ backyard and tear
up the floorboards inside his house.<sup>8</sup> No money was found. Police
theorize that he took the million dollars with him when he disappeared in
1967. While Thomas Richards was declared legally dead in June of 1982 at the
age of 57, his actual whereabouts, and the whereabouts of the $1.5 million,
remain a mystery to this
day.<sup>9</sup>
