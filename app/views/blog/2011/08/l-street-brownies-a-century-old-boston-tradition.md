# L Street Brownies: A Century-Old Boston Tradition

Update: As of October 21, 2013 there is <a

post on our
website.

As an intern at the Media Library and Archives of WGBH, I have come across
many interesting index cards in the process of transcribing them into the
Filemaker database for the Boston Local TV News Digital Library Project.
Recently, a card about 250 feet of news footage filmed on January 4th and 8th,
1969 caught my
eye:

winter
beach.”

Winter beach? That must have been a rather unpleasant
swim.

A little poking around on the Internet gave me some insight into who these L
Street Brownies were and why they would have been swimming outside in the
winter of
1969.

Bostonians (sometimes disguised as <a
href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/gallery/1_1_11_polar_plunge?pg=5">penguins</a>)
have been jumping into the Boston Harbor for over a hundred years as part of
the annual "L Street Brownies New Year's Day Swim." It is in fact one of the
great Beantown traditions, alongside running the Boston Marathon, singing
“Sweet Caroline” at Fenway, or pahking ya cah in hahvahd
yahd.

Swimming in near-freezing water is not only a Boston thing - there are “polar
bear” swimming clubs all over the US, including the <a
href="http://doorbell.net/pbc/">Jacksonport Polar Bear Club</a>, who have been
jumping into Lake Michigan since 1986 and the <a
href="http://www.longbeachpolarbears.org/index.php">Long Beach Polar
Bears</a>, who have been jumping into the Atlantic since 1998. While there is
some debate about which is the oldest club in the US, (The Coney Island Polar
Bears of New York also claim the title), the L Street Brownies made their
first documented dip in 1904, with women joining in the ‘fun’ in the 1980s.
The name “L Street Brownies” is derived from the L Street beach where they
swam and from the tan they would get from being out on the beach
everyday.

Some take the icy dip for fun, some to raise money for charity, others find it
to be healthful or sobering, and millions of sane people watch it from the
comfort of their living room
TVs.

Check out a <a

of the 2009 New Year’s Day Swim on NECN and and <a
href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/gallery/1_1_11_polar_plunge/
">photos</a> of the 2011 Swim on
Boston.com.

Will you take the leap next New Year’s? I guarantee that a steaming hot
bread-bowl of clam chowdah will never have tasted so good as after that
swim.
