Feature content in a JavaScript powered slideshow gallery showcase on your WordPress website

== Description ==

Feature content in a JavaScript powered slideshow gallery showcase on your WordPress website.

You can easily display multiple galleries throughout your WordPress website displaying your custom added slides, slide galleries or showing slides from WordPress posts.

The slideshow is flexible and all aspects can easily be configured.

Embedding or hardcoding the slideshow gallery is a breeze. To embed into a post/page, simply insert `[slideshow]` into its content with an optional `gallery_id` parameter to show slides from a specific gallery `[slideshow gallery_id="7"]` or an optional `post_id` parameter to display the gallery images uploaded to that post/page `[slideshow post_id="123"]`. You can also use an `exclude` parameter to exclude certain images (attachments/slides) by their IDs in the gallery (comma separated) from the slideshow like this `[slideshow post_id="123" exclude="3,7,9"]`. 

To hardcode into any PHP file of your WordPress theme, simply use `<?php if (function_exists('slideshow')) { slideshow($output = true, $gallery_id = false, $post_id = false, $params = array()); } ?>`.

You can use any of the following parameters with both the hardcoding and shortcode to customize each slideshow gallery:

* `resizeimages` [ true | false ] = Set to 'true' to resize images to fit the slideshow dimensions.
* `orderby` [ random ] = Set to 'random' to randomly order the slides. Leave this shortcode parameter to order by the order set on the slides.
* `width` [ width | auto ] = Width of the slideshow in pixels. Don't specify 'px' part, just the numeric value for the height.
* `height` [ height ] (default: setting) = Height of the slideshow in pixels. Don't specify the 'px' part, just the numeric value for the height.
* `auto` [ true | false ] (default: setting) = Set this to 'true' to automatically slide the slides in the slideshow.
* `autospeed` [ speed ] (default: setting) = Speed of the auto sliding. 10 is normal. Lower number is faster. Between 5 and 15 is recommended.
* `fadespeed` [ speed ] (default: setting) = Speed of the fading of images. 10 is normal. Lower number is faster. Between 1 and 20 is recommended.
* `shownav` [ true | false ] (default: setting) = Set to 'true' to show the next/previous image navigation buttons.
* `navopacity` [ opacity ] (default: setting) = The opacity of the next/previous buttons. Between 0 and 100 with 0 being transparent and 100 being fully opaque.
* `navhoveropacity` [ opacity ] (default: setting) = The opacity of the next/previous buttons on hovering. Between 0 and 100 with 0 being transparent and 100 being fully opaque.
* `showinfo` [ true | false ] (default: setting) = Set to 'true' to show the information bar for each slide.
* `infospeed` [ speed ] (default: setting) = Speed at which the information bar will slide up. Between 5 and 15 is recommended.
* `showthumbs` [ true | false ] (default: setting) = Set to 'true' to show the thumbnails for the slides.
* `thumbsposition` [ top | bottom ] (default: setting) = Set to "top" to show above the slideshow.
* `thumbsborder` [ hexidecimal color ] (default: setting) = Hex color of the active thumb border. For example #333333.
* `thumbsspeed` [ speed> ] (default: setting) = Speed of the thumbnail bar scrolling. Lower is slower. Between 1 and 20 is recommended.
* `thumbsspacing` [ spacing ] (default: setting) = An integer value in pixels to space the thumbnails apart. Donâ€™t include the 'px' part, just the number. Between 0 and 10 is recommended.
