# “Hi Dad”

by Jake
Sadow

While transcribing cards for the Boston Public Library, I ran across an
unassuming entry titled “Clocks.” The entry was undated and the description
was uninformative, containing only, “faces of many types of clocks—Sil
Color—also scenes outside of Tick Tock Lane.” I was mildly curious about Tick
Tock Lane, a name that inspired visions of a Willy Wonka style wonderland of
clocks and small, orange-skinned engineers. So I began to research it with a
simple Google search, which led me down a rabbit hole of murder and
intrigue.

Tock Lane</a> was a factory in Weymouth, MA owned by a man named Elmer O.
Stennes. Stennes was a clockmaker, who specialized in designing and building
replica, antique clocks.<sup>1</sup> He also designed original clocks and
served as the president of the New England Watch and Clock Collectors
Association.<sup>2</sup> From here the story takes a turn for the strange and
awful.

On December 2, 1968, the police received a 911 call from Stennes. When they
arrived, they discovered his wife dead in the bathroom with a single gunshot
wound to the head. The murder weapon, a .357 magnum, was found in the house
and the next day Elmer Stennes was charged with murder.<sup>3</sup> He was
eventually convicted on manslaughter and served four years in
prison.<sup>4</sup>

Upon his release, Stennes returned to his clockmaking business and remarried
in 1973.<sup>5</sup> (Who would marry a man known for murdering his last
spouse?) Stennes’s new start was not to last. On October 4, 1975, two men
burst into his bedroom and opened fire. Stennes was killed with four gunshots
to his mouth. His wife was shot seven times, but survived and called the
police. The wife claimed that one of the shooters was her stepson, who said
“hi Dad” before opening fire.<sup>6</sup> The son, Elliot Stennes, was charged
with first-degree murder, but the charges were dropped due to a lack of
evidence.<sup>7</sup> No one was ever convicted for the murder of Elmer
Stennes.

Having learned this, the question that stands out most in my mind, other than
the identity of Stennes’s murderer, is why WHDH was filming scenes of Tick
Tock Lane. There is no date for the footage, but based on the surrounding
film, it is very likely that it was created between 1967 and 1969. If filmed
in 1967, it might have been no more than a puff piece on an eccentric
clockmaker. If it was made later, it might have been intended as background
for a piece on the murder of his wife. This question can only be answered by
finding and reviewing the film that aired and contained this footage, if it
still exists in a usable state, and if it was ever used at
all.
