# From VHS to MPEG

by Jason
Ong

At Cambridge Community Television, we have a collection of archived programs
on 3/4 tapes, VHS tapes, MiniDV tapes, and DVDs. This year, we encoded the
programs that were on VHS tapes, over 1000 of them, into MPEG
files.

First, we took all the VHS tapes out of our archive closet, stored them in a
separate area, and labeled each one with an identifying number. Then, we had a
group of volunteers, of which I was one, survey each tape to find the start
time and end time of the program on that
tape.

We used this information to program our Tiltrac VHS Robot, which was a stack
of VHS decks coupled with a robotic arm that could select a tape from a shelf,
load it into a deck, and play it. While the Robot was playing back a tape, our
encoding hardware created an MPEG of the
program.

Once the Robot was programmed, the whole encoding process was automatic. All
we had to do was load it with VHS tapes. This was important because CCTV was
moving to a new facility at the time, and we were all busy packing up the old
building and getting the new one
ready.

We were not planning to bring the Robot to the new facility. So we had to
complete the survey and encode processes before our final moving date, which
we did, with time to
spare.

The result: the programs that were on over 1000 VHS tapes, which are shelved
along one wall of a closet, have been encoded into over 1000 MPEGs, which are
stored on two hard drives that can sit on a
desk.
