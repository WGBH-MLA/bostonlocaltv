When I first came to Northeast Historic Film I began what then seemed like the
endless task of creating an inventory of the WCVB collection.  Now, a year and
a half later, I finally made it through all 3,759 of those red cans.  I have
placed barcodes and collected information on 14,713 reels which total about
3.5 million feet of film.  This collection is far from fully processed, but we
now have an idea of what is on these reels and have taken the first step to
providing access to this massive amount of
film.

I am not completely done with the collection.  We have a lot of videotapes and
a few more random boxes of news film with intriguing labels like “birds” and
“Kennedy” which need to be looked through, but just walking into the vault and
seeing the rows of labeled red cans gives me a feeling of accomplishment.  I
can see that progress has been made and am excited to share this information
with the public and move onto the next big step: making not only the limited
information about these reels visible, but bringing the images and stories
hidden within these cans to the
public.
