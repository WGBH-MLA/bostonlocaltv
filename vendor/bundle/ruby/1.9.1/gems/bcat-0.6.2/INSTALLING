bcat is known to work under MacOS X, Linux, and FreeBSD (other UNIX-like
environments with freedesktop.org integration should work fine too). Progressive
output has been tested under Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and GNOME Epiphany.

bcat is written in Ruby and requires a basic Ruby installation. Install bcat
using the gem command:

    $ gem install bcat

bcat depends on the rack package.
