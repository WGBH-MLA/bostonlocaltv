# Digitize on Demand

We're very excited to offer a remarkable feature that allows you to
participate directly in preserving Boston history. Through our Digitization on
Demand program you can select any artifact from our <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;non_video=yes&amp;q=&amp;search_field=all_fields&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">catalog
of over 50,000 items</a>, and help save a piece of local history by sponsoring
its
preservation.

It's easy. While searching our catalog, if you come across an items that
you're excited to see digitized and preserved, all you have to do is request
it. We'll contact you about the costs of digitization, and soon the video will
be streaming on our site for free public
access.

Why do we want your help? We know our users are excited about getting access
to this content. When we first launched back in 2012, we got over 1,000 votes
for items users wanted digitized. We want to continue to give you the
opportunity to choose what's available. Our collections don't just cover
politics and events, they contain a wealth of history about your
neighborhoods, your communities, possibly even your friends and family, and
who knows, maybe even you. Because it's YOUR history, YOU should be the ones
who choose what
endures.

Why do we need your help? The bulk of this collection exists on 16mm film or
3/4" videotape, formats which are now at risk of deterioration. If these items
are allowed to deteriorate before we can preserve them, the sights and sounds
they contain will be lost forever. We have been able to preserve over 1,000
items so far, but we don't want to stop there. To ensure that even more of the
Boston TV News collections will survive and be made available, we need your
help. We also want to acknowledge your contribution, so with your permission,
we'll add a sponsorship note to the
item.

If you think the cost of archival preservation might be more than you can
afford, don't let that stop you from showing your interest in an item. If we
get more than one request for an item, we'll contact all the interested
parties and ask if they want to share the costs. You can also track items you
want to see digitized, and we'll let you know if someone else sponsors
them.
