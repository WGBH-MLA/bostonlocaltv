# Bill McKibben speaks at Cambridge Earth Day, 1990

There's been a lot of debate and discussion over the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Pipeline">Keystone Pipeline</a>, a
system that would transport crude oil from Canada to the United States for
processing. Supporters of the project claim that it will create jobs and
secure a nearby source of oil, while opponents cite environmental issues like
an increase in greenhouse gases and the possibility of water
pollution.

One of these opponents has been <a

activist</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_McKibben">Bill
McKibben</a>, who led a nonviolent protest in November 2011 at the White House
to try to convince the administration to stop the
project.

His opposition to the pipeline has really brought him into the public eye, but
McKibben has had a long history as an environmental activist. He was the
keynote speaker at Cambridge's <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day">Earth Day</a> in 1990, an event
which CCTV covered in depth, and footage of which I found in our
archives.

He spoke about the need for more energy efficient light bulbs and cars; 20
years later, regular incandescent light bulbs are being phased out in favor of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_fluorescent_lamp">CFLs</a>, and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cars">hybrid cars</a> are gaining
popularity. He also advocated sharing environmentally-friendly technologies
with the developing world, so they could avoid repeating our country's
mistakes. Today, this is a common criticism aimed at China; its development in
some ways imitates what the United States used to do before environmental
regulation.

McKibben’s speech also mentioned Ohio Valley coal-burning plants and the
subsequent presence of acid rain in New England. 20 years later, his
opposition to Keystone is rooted in how it could push the entire earth over
the tipping point in carbon emissions. He’s had a longstanding belief that the
value of local projects must be measured in terms of their wider
effects.
