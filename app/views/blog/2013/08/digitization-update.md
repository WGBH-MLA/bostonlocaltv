# Digitization Update

We're excited to announce that we're nearing the end of our initial round of
digitizing for the Boston TV News Project. While there's still a lot more work
to be done before we can begin posting video to the website, being able to
view the footage has allowed up to enhance the records with a lot more
metadata. Each collection is being processed separately, and so is at a
slightly different stage, but we hope to have them all finalized soon, so we
can start sharing this historic footage with the
public.

Here’s a quick update on the steps we’ve been taking with each collection to
get it ready for this final
stage.

<strong>The WCVB Collection:</strong> NHF has worked very hard to digitize
selection from their 16mm film collection: 126 stories so far. Since the only
information we originally captured about the film was the footage length,
date, and a short title based on the slug, digitizing has shed a lot of light
on what the collection actually contains. Not only can see get a better sense
of the content of the stories, but it’s also easier for us to see what
percentage are B&amp;W vs. Color and Sound vs. Silent, as well as if content
is original footage, edited stories, or both. The video files are being
prepared to go
online.

<strong>The CCTV Collection:</strong> CCTV has, as previously posted on this
blog, digitized their entire VHS archives. These were all captured as .mpg
files, and some of the selections have been made from those files. The other
main part of the CCTV archives is on 3/4 inch video tape, from which they had
selections transferred to Digibetas. WGBH digitized those Digibetas and is
preparing them to go
online.

<strong>The Ten O’Clock News Collection:</strong> WGBH made selections of
stories that were both on ¾ inch and Digitbeta tapes. We digitized anything
that was already on Digibeta, and sent the ¾ inch tapes to be transferred to
Digibetas. The ¾ inch tapes ended up need to be baked before they could be
transferred. Once we go these Digibetas back, they were also digitized and are
now being prepared to go
online.

<strong>The WHDH Collection: </strong>The WHDH Collection, housed by the BPL,
was probably the hardest collection to get to the final stage. While we have
over 25,000 records from original catalog card, which do provide some useful
information, the actual inventory of the cans of film themselves, stored
offsite, is not complete. We made selections based on the catalog records, but
the BPL team had to work very hard to find some of those stories based on
sometimes incomplete can numbers. Once the cans were identified, they handed
them over to NHF, who is digitizing the film. Digitization is in process, and
those files will then be prepared to go
online.

While we can’t add video to the website just yet, we can share stills from
some of the stories we’ve digitized. Here are some highlights from the 3
collections that have started their digitization so
far.
