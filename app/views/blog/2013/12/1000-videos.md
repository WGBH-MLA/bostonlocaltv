Simply as a coincidence of our processing workflow, this latest batch of media
has a large number of stories about former Boston School Superintendent Laval
Wilson, which can be found <a

While not an especially well known figure, Wilson had quite a dramatic career
in Boston, where he became the first black superintendent in 1985. Following
the busing crisis of the late '70s, Wilson inherited an unstable school system
with many problems. Throughout his time serving he had troubles with the
Boston School Committee and the press. You can start to follow his career
through the stories we have up so far; and keep in mind there are even more to
come!
