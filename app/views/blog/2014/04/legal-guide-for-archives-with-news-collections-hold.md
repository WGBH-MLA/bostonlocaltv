potential legal risks involved local TV news

When local TV stations switched from shooting on film to mostly and then
entirely shooting on videotape, most didn't want to maintain their film
libraries. Luckily, instead of throwing all of this wonderful historical
footage away, many chose to donate it to a local libraries and archives. The
problem we face now is that we have these rich collections with their unique
local content, and we just don't know what we're allowed to do with them. In
most cases, even if the stations kept paperwork, like contracts and materials
releases (which many didn't), there's little chance that made it to the
archive. So with little to no paperwork and often no stations to turn to for
answers (many have gone out of business or change ownership since the 1970s,
when this shift occurred), what's an archive to do? Just let the film sit
there, rather than sharing it with a public that is most likely curious,
interested, and
nostalgic?

One of the goals of this project was to extensively examine the rights issues
associated with local TV news collections in archives, and then to share our
findings. WGBH's legal department teamed up with the Cyberlaw Clinic at the
Berkman Center for Internet and Society, based out of Harvard Law School. We
created hypothetical archival scenarios, to help bridge the gap between the
project archivists and the lawyers. The first product of this collaboration
was a primer on the laws that archivists would be most likely to run into when
examining the risks of digitizing and publishing local TV news collections.
The primer was extensive, well researched, and ultimately daunting, especially
for a non-lawyer. We struggled to find a way to make it more user-friendly for
archivists, so that you didn't need to already have some legal expertise to
find the primer useful. Eventually we decided that a <a

outlining the different types of laws (copyright, trademark, torte, and
contract), would be a easier, less daunting, and more useful resource. In the
small space of the flowchart, we weren't able to address the complexities of
each type of law; however, it is very useful is discovering which laws it will
be necessary to look into further. The flowchart we have published is meant to
be used as a tool for starting to think about the possibilities of your
collection. It is in no way a substitute for legal
advice.
