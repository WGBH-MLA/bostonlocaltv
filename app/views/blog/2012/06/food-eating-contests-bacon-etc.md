Update: As of October 21, 2013 there is <a

post on our
website.

There are few things I love more than food. While I much prefer to savor my
meals, there is something fascinating at the spectacle of people trying to eat
as much food as possible in as little time as possible, which is why I was
thrilled to find not one, not two, but seven stories about <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_eating">eating contests</a> in
the WCVB assignment sheets. These sheets don’t have a whole lot of
information; we’re lucky to get a location and we don’t ever find out who won,
lost, participated in, or even attended these contest, but at least we know
the most important part: which food is being competitively eaten. We have a
story on eating <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermelon">watermelon</a>, one about <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_chips">potato chips</a>, one about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana">bananas</a> and another about <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_split">banana splits</a>. There are
also two about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueberry_pie">blueberry
pies</a>, and one about <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti">spaghetti</a> (they don't say if
it's with or without sauce). I can’t really decide which one I think would be
the most fun to watch, but luckily all of them were filmed, and have a chance
to be <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/blog/2012/02/coming-soon-the-catalog/">digitized</a>.

In addition to eating contests stories, WCVB had a lot of other stories about
food, as they should, considering food is a part of people’s everyday lives.
Here are some of the most interesting of
those:
