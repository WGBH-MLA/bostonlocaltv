There are many ways to remember President Kennedy on this 50th anniversary of
his assassination. Although our collections start just at the end of his life,
there are a few bits of footage featuring his presidency, including the <a

convention</a> and his <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog/V_MI2ANSMY52LRA5N">inauguration
speech</a>.

There is also a broad range of stories that demonstrate the way Bostonians are
affected by his life and legacy
everyday.

People remember him at the Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston, which
features artifacts from and commentary on his personal and political life. It
opened in 1979 after some controversy, an event which was documented in this
<a href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog/V_613L444USRX0LGF">story</a>. Other
important events have been held at the Kennedy Library since its opening,
including the <a

Ground town meeting</a> in
1985.

He's also remembered at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University. The collection is full of <a

and panels held at the Kennedy School</a> by notable people, speaking about
important topics that we must assume JFK himself would have cared about
deeply.

We encourage you to search through our collections for other ways of remember
Kennedy, as well. A search through out non-video assets may reveal a yet
undiscovered piece, and if you're interested in seeing it, please contact us,

free streaming access to the
