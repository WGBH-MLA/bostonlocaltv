It seems pretty timely that this is the week New England is going to be hit by
Snowmageddon (or Snowpocalypse, if you prefer). It was this week 35 years ago
that the <a

of 1978</a> hit Boston.Â  Notice the difference in terminology there? Even with
the overwhelming aftermath, it was only called a blizzard, or as the newsmen
preferred, storm. With over 2 feet of snow hitting Boston, the blizzard cause
over $520 million in damages ( or $1.85 billion in present terms), and took
the lives of about 100 people. Such a devastating storm will always be
remembered in Boston
history.

We're not sure how this storm is going to play out for Boston here in 2013,
but we can check out the news stories on the 1978 <a
