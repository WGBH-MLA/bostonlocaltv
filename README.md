- Funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the Council on Library and Information Resources. 
- Collaborators:
  - Boston Public Library’s WHDH film collection (1960- mid-1970s)
  - Cambridge Community Television (1988 to 1999)
  - Northeast Historic Film’s WCVB film collection (1970-1979)
  - WGBH-produced The Reporters (1970-1973), Evening Compass (1973-1975) and the Ten O’Clock News

## Ingest

PBCore collection documents should be kept in [S3](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1#&bucket=bostonlocaltv.org&prefix=pbcore/)
with conventional names. All S3 docs can be downloaded and reingested with `script/ingest.sh`.

## Old Documentation

Old docs are available here: https://github.com/WGBH/bostonlocaltv/wiki.
I plan to replace them over time with current information here in the readme.
