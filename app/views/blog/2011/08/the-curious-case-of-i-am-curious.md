# The Curious Case of "I am Curious"

“I am Curious (Yellow)” premiered in Boston on November 10, 1969 at the <a
href="http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/6445">Symphony Cinemas I &amp;
II</a> on Huntington Avenue, a now defunct art-house theater which operated in
the late 1960s and 70s. “<a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061834/">Curious</a>,” a 1967 Swedish film
by director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilgot_Sj%C3%B6man">Vilgot
Sjöman</a>, was the first part of a two-part series (“I am Curious [Blue]” was
the second) that, according to the <a
href="http://www.criterion.com/films/728-i-am-curiousyellow">Criterion
Collection’s synopsis</a>, tells “the story of Lena (Lena Nyman), a searching
and rebellious young woman, and her personal quest to understand the social
and political conditions in 1960s Sweden, as well as her bold exploration of
her own sexual identity.” That bold exploration— which included what the
<em>Boston Globe </em>considered to be “without question the most explicit
[sex scenes] ever shown on U.S. public screens”— resulted in the film being
impounded by U.S. Customs in 1968 and held in seizure until 1969 when a U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled it fit for uncut
screening.

No doubt intrigued by the film’s controversy and hype, Bostonians waited in
lines extending onto Huntington Ave. for tickets to the two-hour film. But
“Curious” would only run five times that day, as city police arrived at the
Symphony Cinemas around 5:15pm and seized the reels from both theaters,
leaving audience members for the 3 and 4pm shows literally in the dark. The
ban came from Massachusetts Superior Court <a
href="http://www.massreports.com/memorials/default.aspx?m=421ma1603">Chief
Justice G. Joseph Tauro</a>, who issued a 60-page ruling that labeled the film
obscene—and therefore subject to state regulation—after it met the Supreme
Court’s three criteria for obscenity as established in the 1957 case <a
href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0354_0476_ZS.html"><em>Roth
v. United States</em></a><em> </em>(more on that
shortly)<em>.</em>

Judge Tauro’s November 1969 decision was viewed by some as an extension of an
obscenity trial that had been held the previous summer against the same two
men targeted in the “Curious” case: James Vlamos, the film’s distributor, and
Scraphim Karalexis, the manager of Symphony Cinema. An hour after Judge
Tauro’s decision, Karalexis and Vlamos sought a temporary <a
href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/injunction">injunction</a> from a
local Federal District Court to stop Massachusetts state authorities from
barring the film’s screening until litigation had been fully completed. A week
later the Federal court injunction was granted, thereby allowing Karalexis to
screen the film without state interference. In its 2-1 decision the Federal
court also stated that consenting adults, when properly warned by cinema
management of the film’s potentially offensive content, should under
constitutional law be permitted to view “Curious,” and that the Symphony
Cinema was not in the wrong since they properly barred minors from
attending.

width="267" height="177" /></a>However, citing the unexceptional and in no way
unusual circumstances fueling the Federal Court’s interference in a pending
state criminal prosecution, Boston District Attorney Garrett Byrne <a
href="http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/396/396.US.976.html">applied
for and received a stay</a> on the November 1969 injunction from the U.S.
Supreme Court. As a result, “Curious” could not be screened until the
Massachusetts judicial system had run its course, which many people in Boston
mistakenly took as a sign that the Supreme Court had upheld Judge Tauro’s ban
on grounds of
obscenity.

<a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/401/216/case.html"><em>Byrne v.
Karalexis</em></a> was eventually brought before the Supreme Court again in
April and November 1970, and decided in late 1971. Ultimately, the Supreme
Court ruled that the distribution and screening of “I am Curious (Yellow)” in
Boston theaters was legal since “widespread public distribution to an
unwilling public” was never a fundamental feature of the case, nor were
children unwittingly exposed to the material. The constitutionality of U.S.
obscenity laws was not modified in the course of the
trial.

To better understand Judge Tauro’s 1969 ruling, it’s worthwhile to take a look
at the laws from which he drew his opinion. In 1957, the Supreme Court in
<em>Roth v. United States</em> established a method for judging obscenity that
was based largely upon the vague idea of contemporary community standards. The
<em>Roth </em>decision set up a three-pronged test for sniffing out obscenity,
stating that materials could be deemed obscene (and subsequently subject to
regulation)
if:
<ol>
	<li>The dominant theme of the work, as a whole, appeals to a <a
href="http://www.answers.com/topic/prurient">prurient</a> interest in
sex;</li>
	<li>The work was patently offensive because it affronted contemporary
community standards in its representation of
sex;</li>
	<li>The work was utterly without redeeming social
value.</li>
</ol>
While <em>Roth</em> <em>v. United States</em> reaffirmed the notion that all
ideas with even the slightest shred of redeeming social importance were fully
protected under the First Amendment, it also held that speech which encroached
upon the “limited area of more important interests” was not. The issue arose
when state judiciaries, citing national mores, found certain works to entirely
lack any sort of redeeming social value. Under this logic, material deemed
obscene was not constitutionally protected under the First Amendment and could
therefore be open to state regulation. That’s where the “Curious” case came
from.

Although <em>Byrne v. Karalexis </em>ended up centering more on the procedural
niceties of state and federal court action than on censorship law, this
‘curious’ case was incremental in a larger judicial narrative that eventually
brought about the 1973 <em>Miller v. California </em>case, a ruling which
still dictates how materials are branded obscene in the United States<em>.
Miller</em>, like <em>Roth</em>, set up a three-pronged test for obscenity.
The difference with <em>Miller</em>, however, was that local standards and not
national mores became the test’s primary emphasis. Distribution of materials
in a state could be halted if three yeses appeared in response to these
questions:
<ol>
	<li>Would an average person applying contemporary community standards find
that the work as a whole appealed to prurient interest in
sex?</li>
	<li>Does the work depict or describe in a patently offensive way sexual
conduct specifically prohibited in a state’s
law?</li>
	<li>Does the work, as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political, or
scientific
vale?</li>
</ol>
Much as “Curious” proved to be a fine polemic, it was received in Boston and
other U.S. cities with opinions ranging from mixed to downright contemptuous.
Edgar Driscoll, a staff writer for the <em>Boston Globe, </em>called the film
“a two-hour bore,” a “big put-on and take off from start to finish.” The
<em>New York Times</em> described it as a “genuinely vile and disgusting
Swedish meatball,” placing “Curious” at the “bottom of the garbage dump” of
recent avant-garde films that they named “The Trash Explosion.” And a suburban
Houston theater screening the film was burnt to the ground, the work of what
the theater’s owners called “moral
vigilantes.”

Do you remember the controversy caused by the film “I am Curious
(Yellow)”?
