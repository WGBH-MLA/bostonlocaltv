# David Crowley and Cranberries

As an Intern on the Boston Local TV News Project you might enter data for 200
or more cards on any given day, so it makes sense that the cards that have
unusual wording or cover an especially exciting news event start to stand out
to you. For example, after logging hundreds of cards on Boston’s city council
you may stumble on a title that at first glance sounds strange, like
<strong>“Cranberry Juice: Official Juice of the State.”</strong> A little bit
of research later and you find that, incidentally, cranberry juice was
declared the <a

juice of the state</a> in 1970 in honor of the Massachusetts cranberry
industry. Click <a

to vote to digitize these
stories.

my interest was a card on someone named Daniel Crowley.<!--more read
more...--> Of the many cards bearing his name a few read something like this,
<strong>“Found after being lost for eight days on New Hampshire
Mountain.”</strong> This seemed pretty intense to me - I mean who hasn’t seen
the movie 127 hours (after all that Oscar buzz this year) about a man
struggling to survive after being trapped in the middle of nowhere by a
boulder for five
days?

So with my imagination running wild I did a little bit of digging through the
Boston Globe’s archives once again, only to discover that Daniel Crowley was a
twelve year-old
boy.

he got tired and lagged behind on a hike to the top of <a
href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?ftid=0x4cb3717a7d0a93c1:0x4c5997be8aa8eaab&amp;q=Mt.+Passaconaway&amp;hl=en&amp;ved=0CA4Q-gswAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Lt_WTfeuFIW8yQW0h6S1BQ&amp;sig2=VxuL48_cNskh6id_aFVwHQ">Mt.
Passaconaway</a>. Upon the hikers retreat back down the mountain, David,
feeling better and wanting the badge that he would get after reaching the peak
of each of five local mountains, went on to try to reach the top alone and got
lost. Once David realized he was lost, he stayed put and survived on water
from a nearby stream and berries. When the boy was eventually found after
seven or eight days, he told rescuers that he thinks he could have lasted out
in the wilderness much longer. Well, that and he wanted a Hamburger and
Fries.

I’ll be interested to see the footage we dig up on this spunky kid, and
<strong>David Crowley… if you’re out there… did you ever earn those other four
badges?
