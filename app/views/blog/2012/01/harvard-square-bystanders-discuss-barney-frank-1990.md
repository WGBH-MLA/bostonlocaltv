Massachusetts Congressman <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_frank">Barney Frank</a> has
announced that he will not be running for reelection this year, ending over 30
years of service in the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives">House
of
Representatives</a>.

However, his image was tarnished in 1990, during the Steve Gobie scandal.
Gobie was a male prostitute who lived in the congressman's apartment as a
personal aide and housekeeper. Frank paid Gobie's legal bills and used some
influence to dismiss Gobie's parking
tickets.

Frank and Gobie met when Frank hired Gobie as a prostitute, for escort
services. That in itself would be seen in a negative light by some people. But
the real scandal began when Gobie was found to be running an actual
prostitution service from Frank's apartment with, Gobie claimed, Frank’s full
knowledge. Frank terminated Gobie’s employment, but Gobie told his story to
the
press.

Frank denied that he’d been aware of Gobie’s service, and he agreed to let the
<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Standards_of_Official_Conduct">House
Ethics Committee</a> conduct a full investigation. But he said that he would
not consider resigning from Congress until after the Committee issued its
report.

During this time, CCTV producers talked to some people around Harvard Square
and asked them if they thought the congressman should resign. I found this
20-year old footage in the CCTV
archives.

Most people said that he should not. They said that there were more important
problems to deal with, that he was an effective legislator, and that his
personal life was not an issue. A few people said that he should, to preserve
the integrity of the office, and that what he did was wrong and
illegal.

Some people thought Frank was getting special treatment because of his
homosexuality: that if he were living with a female prostitute, he would have
gotten more pressure to resign. Conversely, one person felt that because he
was homosexual, he was getting harsher treatment, perhaps from people who
disapproved of homosexuality to begin
with.

The House Committee issued a formal reprimand, and Frank did not resign. He
went on to win all of his subsequent reelection bids, most of them with a
comfortable majority of the vote, and several of them with no opposition. It
seems that the people of his district generally felt the same way as the
bystanders in Harvard
Square.
