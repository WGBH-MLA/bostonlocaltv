Andre the Seal was a beloved figure in New England in the 1970s and 80s. I
knew about him from the 1994 motion picture <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_%28film%29">Andre</a>, which is based
on the true story or at least on <a
href="http://books.google.com/books?id=16bN3yE6D5EC&amp;q=andre+the+seal&amp;dq=andre+the+seal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D8yRT7ObEYLe6QHP5siiBA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAQ">the
book</a>, which is based on the actual true story. (A lot of hardcore Andre
the Seal fans, don’t really get behind the movie.) No matter how true to life
the children’s movie is, we now know that there is film footage of the actual
Andre the Seal in our very own WCVB collection. For those who don’t know a lot
about Andre the Seal and his local significance to Boston, let me give you a
little
history.

Andre was a harbor seal, who was born in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockport,_Maine">Rockport, Maine</a> in
1961. Harry Goodridge, his trainer, found him when he was 2 days old and had
been abandoned by his mother. He raised him and taught him to do tricks, which
amused the Rockport tourists. However, as he got older, Andre became so
friendly with people that he would jump into boats, sometimes capsizing them.
When it was decided that Andre couldn’t spend all year roaming freely in
Rockport, Goodridge arranged for him to spend his winters at the <a
href="http://www.neaq.org/index.php">New England Aquarium</a> in Boston,
starting in 1973. The seal was transported down from Maine to Boston every
year, first by truck,
and

later by plane. At the end of his stay, Andre was let go off the coast of
Marblehead, where he began his swim up the coast back home to Rockport. He
usually made the trip in less than five days, although one time he took
fourteen, having elected to take a more round about route. This annual swim
became a huge tourist sensation, and as a <a
href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> search will show you, was
reported on by many local papers every
year.

While there are many stories in the collection about Andre either being
brought down to the Aquarium or swimming back to Maine, here are the
descriptions from the assignment sheets of the more interesting highlights of
Andre’s life that we have on
film:

<em><strong>Andre and
Spot</strong></em>
<em>Andre the Seal has a new companion. He’s Spot and he swims in the tank
with
Andre</em>

<em><strong>Cabot Spot Goes to
Andre</strong></em>
<em>God forbid, Andre, the famous seal, friend of Spence Gregory, Chet Curtis,
Jim Thislek and Jon Henning [all WCVB reporters/executives], should live alone
in Maine. He needs Cabot Spot to share his summer vacation
digs.</em>

<em><strong>Smoke the
Seal</strong></em>
<em>This is a female harbor seal who was taken in a crate from the aquarium
and taken to Marblehead where she is expected to swim northing looking for her
pal, Andre, the alleged
biter</em>

<em><strong>Andre the Seal Comes
Back</strong></em>
<em>To the aquarium to be reunited with pregnant
Smoke</em>

Over the years Andre spent at the aquarium he befriended other seals, fell in
love, and became a father. His life was full of both human and seal friends,
and in addition to those who knew he well, he had a huge fan base. There is
even a <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/3632">statue of Andre</a>
in Rockport, which he helped to unveil himself. In July 1986 Andre was found
dead, and was laid to rest by his trainer and friend Harry
Goodridge.

I sure never expected this job to lead me to write a blog post about a
pregnant seal (or any kind of seal for that matter), but Andre was a
significant figure in Boston Local News, who I am glad to know more about, and
who’s story I’m happy we have preserved in this
collection.

As part of the first round of digitizing completed during the project, we
digitize several reels of Andre the Seal film, which are now <a
