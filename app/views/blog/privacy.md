# Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting bostonlocaltv.org (the “Site”), owned and maintained by
WGBH Educational Foundation (“WGBH”). The Boston TV News Digital Library:
1960-2000 Project (the “Project”) was created by WGBH in collaboration with
the following “Project Partners”: Boston Public Library, Cambridge Community
Television and Northeast Historic Film. This Site serves to document and share
the progress of the Project with the
public.

We know you don’t want the information you provide us shared indiscriminately.
Here we explain what information WGBH and our third-party vendors and Project
Partners (collectively “we”) acting on our behalf to help deliver the services
and operate and analyze use of the Site collect, what we do with the
information, and what controls you have over the information collected. We’re
committed to ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information,
and to protecting your ability to make financial transactions (if available on
this Site) and transmit your personal data with full
confidence.

The privacy policy set forth here refers solely to bostonlocaltv.org. Please
read it carefully, and if you have any questions or concerns, please contact
us. Also, note that bostonlocaltv.org links to numerous other sites, such as
WGBH, the Boston Public Library, Cambridge Community Television and Northeast
Historic Film. Please consult those sites to learn more about their policies
and terms of
use.

<strong>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT

We collect two types of information from you: a) personally identifiable

you voluntarily supply upon request when you register for the Site, make a
donation, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a
contest or sweepstakes, and/or comment on the Site; and b) Non-personally
identifiable information, for example IP Addresses and cookies, which include
tracking information collected as you navigate through our Site. Uses of this
information are discussed in Section 2
below.

A. Personally Identifiable
Information

We will not collect personally identifiable information from you, other than
what you supply to us on a voluntary basis upon
request.

<em>Registration for our

Anyone can view our Site, however some functions of the Site may require a
free registration which enables full access to the information and resources
offered throughout the Site. A unique email address (user name) and password

B. Non-personally Identifiable
Information

In addition to information that you provide to us, we may also collect and
store certain non-personally identifiable information automatically when you
use the Site. This information helps us improve the experience you and other
visitors have with the
Site.

For example, we may collect your IP address, browser information and reference
site domain, as well as related information such as the date on which you
visit the Site. This information does not identify you personally and is only
used in the
aggregate.

As is common practice among web sites, we use “cookies” and similar
technologies. In general, cookies – the informational files that your web
browser places on your computer when you visit a website – are used on this
Site to track and analyze how you and other visitors use our Site. We use
these cookies in order to improve the Site, to identify the source of visitors
and what pages you use while on our site, to offer visitors interactive and/or
personalized features that would not be possible without the cookies, to
recall specific information to save visitors time when they return to the
Site, to provide our sponsors targeted sponsorship opportunities, to provide
visitors customized sponsorship messages or list of customized videos of
interest, and to identify usage and statistical trends. By looking at this
traffic we can better understand our community, which allows us to improve our
Site and to provide you with an optimal experience and better service. Our
sponsorship service vendors, which serve sponsorship messages onto our site,
and third party vendors that measure and analyze the use of the Site for us,
may also use their own cookies. At no time does the cookie reveal your name,
address, or email address (even if you have entered these in specific areas of
the Site). The Site pages cannot extract any personally identifying
information about you from what we receive via a cookie and your
browser.
We also allow third-party companies, including AddThis, to collect certain
anonymous information when you visit our Site. These companies may use
non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this and other
websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to
be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a
third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this
behavioral advertising practice, you can visit
www.networkadvertising.org.

You can set your browser preferences to refuse cookies or to alert you when
cookies are being sent. However, some parts of the Site will not function
properly if you do
so.

<strong>2. HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION GATHERED ON THE
SITE?</strong>

Neither WGBH, nor our third-party vendors acting on our behalf to help deliver
the services and operate the Site, will willfully disclose, sell, exchange or
lend any personally identifiable information about our online users to any
third party other than Project Partners without first receiving the user’s
permission, unless disclosure to third party(ies) is required by law, we
believe in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, we have
received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency, or such
release is necessary to protect anyone’s rights, property or
safety.
In terms of our own use of information, we may use your personally
identifiable information for the activities described in the previous
sections, for the activities described when you submitted the information, or
for internal and marketing promotional purposes as further described in this
policy.
We will typically explain the extent of use at the time you are asked to
provide personal information. If you do not want this information to be
collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply “opt out.” Under
certain circumstances, opting out may prevent your participation in activities
for which personal information is needed, as in contests or
sweepstakes.

As mentioned, in certain cases, we contract with third party vendors to
provide services on our behalf. These vendors maintain customer databases with
email addresses of Site visitors who have provided their email addresses to us
by registering at our site, signing up for a newsletter or email, emailing us
questions about the service, donors who submit online contributions, or online
buyers who make a purchase. We will use these addresses to respond to the
general purposes for which we collected the information, to provide services
and to operate the Site, including to respond to inquiries; to process credit
card payments, billing, and shipping; to process email distribution; for list
processing and analysis; for promotions management; to send information about
WGBH’s programs, services, or your local public broadcasting station’s
membership/fundraising; or to correspond about purchase or product offers. Our
third party vendors have access to your personally identifiable information as
necessary to provide certain services on our behalf. They are required to
maintain the privacy of all such information in their possession or control
and can only use the information for the purpose that we have contracted them,
for example sending you a newsletter. They are not authorized to use your
information for any other
purpose.

Similarly, personally identifiable information provided in connection with a
donation will be shared with third party vendors who perform services to
process the
donation.

On certain pages, we may now or in the future, offer visitors the opportunity
to provide comments, messages or other user-generated text, content or
materials (collectively “User Materials”). Any information that you disclose
when posting a message to these areas, such as your name, screen name or ID
used, becomes public. In addition, we may use the information that you
disclose in these areas for promotional and marketing purposes. We are not
responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to
disclose in these public areas. Further, we may use, copy, sublicense, modify,
transmit, publicly perform, display, create derivative works of, host, index,
cache, tag, encode, and/or adapt any User Materials, and any information
contained therein, in any and all media formats or channels, whether now known
or hereafter devised, including, but not limited to, the Site, public
broadcasting station web sites, other third party web sites, over the air (on
radio or television), and on mobile
platforms.

You may also have the opportunity to engage with our content on the Site, such
as video, text or other offerings, via links or other integrations, on or
through third-party social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) or
third-party social media plug-ins and applications. When you engage with our
content on or through third party social networking sites or via third-party
social media plug-ins and applications, you agree that by doing so, we will
have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name,
email address, photo etc.) to deliver the content or as part of the operation
of the application. When you provide personal information to us from your
social media account, you consent to the use of this information in accordance
with our privacy policy. In addition, when you provide personal information to
us through an application or media plug-in on our Site or on social networking
sites, other members of these sites may publicly view it and we cannot prevent
further use of the information by third parties. For more information about
how social networking sites handle your personal information, please refer to
their privacy policies and terms of use, as we have no control over
information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third
parties.

We may also use the services of third parties to provide us with data
collection, reporting, site analytics, and/or plug-in functionality. These
third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. The use of technologies
by these third parties, including, for example, social media plug-ins, are
subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy
Policy.

We reserve the right to send you email relating to your account status. This
includes notices of credit-card problems and notifications about major changes
to our Site and/or to our Privacy
Policy.

WGBH, with the assistance from time to time of its third party service
vendors, uses non-identifying aggregate information to analyze use of and
better design the Site and to share with third parties in aggregate form only
as appropriate. For example, we may tell a third party that a certain number
of users accessed a particular video on our Site. However, we will not
disclose any information that could be used to identify those
users.

<strong>3. SECURITY OF
INFORMATION</strong>

WGBH has in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and
managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect
online. Credit card information provided on the Site, if any, is protected
against unauthorized use by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security features. The
SSL protocol is the industry standard method for creating an encrypted, secure
connection between your web browser and a web server, such as the Site’s
server. You should, however, keep in mind that no Internet or email
transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Because most email is not
encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send
to us via
email.

<strong>4. CHILDREN’S
GUIDELINES</strong>

This Site is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect or store
personally identifiable information about children under the age of 13. If we
become aware that a child under the age of 13 has made a request for
information, we will respond to the request and any identifying information
will be deleted once we have responded. Similarly, if we become aware that a
child under 13 posted identifiable information on any of our websites, we will
also delete that information. We take children’s privacy very seriously and
encourage parents to contact us with any questions or concerns they may have.
Additionally, if parents want us to delete any collected personally
identifiable information about their children under the age of 13, they can
also contact us at the following website address:
bostonlocaltv@wgbh.org.

<strong>5. CORRECTIONS TO PERSONAL DATA; OPTING
OUT</strong>

Please Contact Us to a) correct or update any personal information in the WGBH
database that you state is erroneous, b) opt-out of future communications from
WGBH, or c) request WGBH to make reasonable efforts to remove your personal
information from the WGBH online database, thereby canceling your profile,
newsletter registration and other WGBH registrations. This will not
necessarily remove previous public comments and other User Materials submitted
for public display on the Site. You should understand that it might be
impossible to delete personal information entirely because of backups and
records of
deletions.
