While reviewing the CCTV program tapes, I came across a story about a rally by
the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers that CCTV covered in 1992.
On December 1st of that year, the <a href="http://www.huctw.org/">Harvard
Union of Clerical and Technical Workers</a> were trying to renew their
contract, but they disagreed with the university administration over some
provisions. The HUCTW staged a rally in Harvard Yard to gather support for
their position, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Jackson">Jesse
Jackson</a>, a supporter of the union, attended and gave a brief
speech.

&nbsp;

Some of his speech covered the union and its problems, but he also spoke about
other political topics, two of which I found very interesting in light of
what's happened in the 19 years since he gave that
speech:

At that time in 1992, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton">Bill
Clinton</a> had been elected, but he was not yet in office. One of his
campaign issues had been the need for healthcare reform, and Reverend Jackson
spoke about the need for a national plan during his speech. But President
Clinton's proposed plan never made it through Congress, and healthcare reform
would not happen until 18 years later, under President
Obama.

On that note, the idea of an African-American president might have seemed
impossible then. In the spring of 1992, Los Angeles had undergone <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots">three days of
rioting</a> over the "not guilty" verdict in the trial of the police officers
who assaulted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King">Rodney
King</a>. Reverend Jackson spoke about the need for different races to come
together.

Would he have predicted back then, given the tense state of race relations,
that the country would elect a minority president within the next 20
years?
