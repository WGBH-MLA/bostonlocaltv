# Remembering Boston local news stories

A young Barack Obama speaking while attending Harvard Law School…Martin Luther
King, Jr. giving an address in Boston…the Blizzard of 1978…Pope John Paul II’s
1979 visit…Mike Dukakis’s 1988 Presidential campaign. These, and other major
events in Boston history, are among the footage contained in the
<strong>Boston TV News Digital Library, 1960-2000</strong>.

<ul>
<li>Were you around during the Blizzard of
’78?</li>
<li>Were you a student or parent during the Boston busing
controversy?</li>
<li>Did you stand in line to see Pope John Paul
II?</li>
</ul>
<em>What stories do you remember? What events were you part of?</em> We’d love
to hear your recollections of the news stories that mean a lot to you, and
footage from these stories may be part of the 40 hours of footage we plan to
stream online.
