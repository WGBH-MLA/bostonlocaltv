# Thank You For Voting!

Thank you all so much for voting for the news stories you want to see
digitized. The voting period has ended, and we’re going to start using your
suggestions to choose which footage we’ll digitize and stream on our website.
We hope to have our choices made by the end of April 2013 and to start
streaming materials sometime after
that.

The voting feature will remain active for the foreseeable future, so feel free
to keep voting! We’ll continue to use these votes to gauge community interest
in stories, and may be able to take these into account for future digitization
efforts.

Thanks again for your support this far. We’re very excited to be able to bring
you news stories we know you want to
see!
