Even though winter is quick to remind us that it isn’t over just yet (see last
week’s snow storm) spring is in the air up here in Maine.  The days are longer
and I am starting to think about getting outside again. One of the biggest
signs for me that spring has finally arrived is the <a

With the race coming up in a couple weeks I did a quick look through the <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/wcvb">WCVB collection</a> to see what kind of
footage we have of past marathons.  I am particularly interested in footage
during the 1970’s as my Dad ran the Boston Marathon several times during that
decade.  All of these races were before I was born, but I cheered him on
through many other marathons throughout my childhood and heard stories of the
Boston Marathon.  It was given special status in my household, as was <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Rodgers_%28athlete%29">Bill
Rodgers</a>, the winner of the race every time my Dad ran it.  As a result I
have never visited Boston without a trip to <a

Center</i></a> in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faneuil_Hall#Faneuil_Hall_Marketplace">Faneuil
Hall Market
Place</a>.

The Boston Marathon isn’t just special in my corner of the world.  It started
in 1897 and is the world’s oldest marathon.  Runners come from all over the
globe to compete in this race, and, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon">according to
Wikipedia</a>, it is one of New England’s most widely viewed sporting
events.

One thing that I find interesting when I look at old running footage is how
the races and the runners change over time.  One WCVB reel from the Boston
Marathon in 1973 has already been transferred.  In this story most of the
runners interviewed both before and after the race lament the fact that it
wasn’t raining.  I have done marathons in the rain and can’t imagine wishing
for those conditions.  I asked my Dad about it.  He couldn’t think of any
reason that you would want to run in the rain but did concede that a lot of
different running theories were circulating through the 1970’s and maybe that
was one of
them.

I hope to see more of this footage.  Not just so I can search for my Dad in
the pack of runners, but also to listen to the interviews and see the
evolution of this amazing
race.
