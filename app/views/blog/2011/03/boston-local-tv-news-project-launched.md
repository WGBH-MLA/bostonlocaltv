# Boston Local TV News Project Launched!

Welcome to the Boston Local Television News Project. This collaboration
between WGBH, the Boston Public Library, Northeast Historic Film and Cambridge
Community Television aims to bring to life local news stories produced in and
about Boston from the early 1960’s to 2000.


We’ll be creating an online catalog of stories from Boston Public Library’s
WHDH film collection (1960- mid-1970s), Cambridge Community Television (1988
to 1999), Northeast Historic Film’s WCVB film collection (1970-1979), and
WGBH-produced The Reporters (1970-1973), Evening Compass (1973-1975) and the
Ten O’Clock
News.

The project will also produce a primer on legal issues surrounding access to
local news stories, create free online Teachers’ Domain items for use in the
classroom, and stream 40 hours of local news stories for free.

participate!
