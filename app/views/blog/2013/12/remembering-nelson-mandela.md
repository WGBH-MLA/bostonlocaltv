High.[/caption]

Nelson Mandela died on December 5, 2013 at the age of 95. During his life, he
was jailed in apartheid controlled South Africa for 27 years and went on to
serve as the country's first black president. This great man was a role model
to many in Boston and across the
world.

Our collections contain some unique footage of Mandela, including this <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog/V_L5N55ATB6GXSBK6">visit to Madison
Park High School</a>. We also have this hour long special produced by the Ten
O'Clock News and Say Brother, <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog/V_FJODRM5UW3YLW0Z">Mandela in
Boston</a>. CCTV also has <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog/4455">footage</a> of musicians playing
on the esplanade in honor of his
visit.

Even when he wasn't in Boston, Mandela still had a great impact on the people
here. Here's a <a

Vaillancourt talks with Boston students about why Mandela is a hero to
them.
