# Scholarly use of the Boston TV News Digital Library

The Boston TV News Digital Library is a true landmark, one of the most
innovative and progressive archival undertakings of the young 21st Century. By
bringing together news cast segments, special reports, news film, and other
televised news coverage materials from the period when television was the
media heartbeat of the region and nation, this project recognizes and makes
accessible for multiple research purposes a socio-cultural commitment and
legacy of news coverage that will help make history come alive and be
renewed.

Local television news is a fundamental feature (and regulatory necessity) of
U.S. television, which, in the decades after World War II, grew proportionally
with the TV industry, expanding to become as much a part of the everyday
public sphere as were daily newspapers and radio broadcasts. Many would say
that television news eclipsed these other media during this era. The online
Boston TV News Digital Library makes newly available the means to assess the
literal and figurative stakes and achievements of this ascendance, especially
regarding Boston and related areas of the Northeast
region.

The significance of this digital library is therefore relevant to various
academic fields across the Humanities and Social Sciences, both within this
region and beyond
it.

Local television is a chronically under-studied area in Film and Media Studies
and Communications Studies. Despite the fact that local broadcasters were
licensed to serve in the public interest, historical and historiographic
investment in the coverage and representational practices of these stations
has been largely casual and anecdotal, when it exists at all. The extant
historical work is not without merit, but the Boston TV News Digital Library
affords an entirely new and different series of opportunities for innovative
research in this field and in this
area.

The narrative saga of local television in Boston is already recognized to be
historically significant, even rather byzantine in its complexity of
licensing, ownership, production facilities, and station affiliation. Two
stations represented in the Boston TV News Digital Library are central to this
surprisingly arcane narrative: WHDH and WCVB. The present report is not the
place to recount this singular history, which includes the only instance in
U.S. history in which a local television station lost its FCC license to
continue broadcasting. But this context is surely part of what will make this
project of great interest to researchers and
scholars.

What is even more primary to this online collection of film and video
materials is the period it captures in relation to the empirical and indexical
realities of the era. These materials capture a period of Boston, its
neighborhoods, and neighboring regions that is distinctive and renowned, but
also deeply contentious and troubled. These news materials capture a deep
historical sense of local and regional place and invested self-identity, but
also a vernacular address to national and international events during an
extraordinarily eventful period. The materials also provide valuable evidence
of historicized formats in local television news and public affairs
programming, that document the range of address that was realized in
performing television's role as a source of topical information and a public
forum.

My cursory initial experience with the digital library’s news materials
demonstrated to me the range and depth of what already exists online, and the
promise of more to come. The period represented is filled with literal reports
but also incidental coverage of many major news figures and landmark events,
but also local interventions such as call-in shows and public forums, that
help to demarcate with precision the historical interpretation and
stratification of topical issues at the time they were most pressing and
immediate. The degree of detail in the descriptions, metadata, and
supplemental online posts that accompany the media materials for the Project
also make possible deep research across and within specific collections over
time. As Sadie Roosa demonstrated in her blog post memorial to <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/blog/2013/12/remembering-nelson-mandela/">Nelson
Mandela</a>, the materials in the Project can range considerably in relation
to indelible historical figures, expanding and modulating our awareness of
their impact on public history and memory. It is worth noting that the Project
also affords access to items and reports on more decidedly ephemeral and
ineffable topics and events. The new research that the Project affords may
well alter the historiographic weight of some of these
materials.

Efforts at other archives and repositories across the inter webs to provide
online access to news collections and archival deposits will learn much from
this project, and all will benefit in relation to one another. The Vanderbilt
News Archive has been collecting network news broadcasts since the late 1960s.
Access to online examples of this collection requires a subscription, which
will place their materials at a remove from most scholars and researchers. But
many other University archives have already demonstrated a commitment to make
at least some of their news materials available online. Prominent examples
include The University of Virginia’s <a
href="http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:2214294">WSLS-TV News
Film Collection</a>, which already features over 3500 clips from this Roanoke,
Virginia station as a searchable online collection; The University of South
Carolina’s Moving Image Research Collection, which features both a <a
href="http://library.sc.edu/mirc/list.html?cat=6">Fox Movietone News
collection</a> and news materials from several local television stations in
their <a href="http://library.sc.edu/mirc/list.html?cat=1">Newsfilm
collection</a>; and The University of Georgia’s local television station <a
href="http://www.libs.uga.edu/media/collections/newsfilm/wsb.html">WSB-TV
Newsfilm Collection</a> and materials from the <a
href="http://www.libs.uga.edu/media/collections/peabody/index.html">Peabody
Awards
Collection</a>.

Within the fields of Film and Media Studies, the Project will soon be
foregrounded in major academic conferences and symposia this spring. It will
be featured in at least two workshop panels at The Society of Cinema and Media
Studies conference in Seattle in March, 2014, and prominently featured on a
panel about online archives and scholarship at the Orphans Film Symposium in
Amsterdam in April,
2014.

The Project will also be prominent in emerging online academic research
environments such as The Media Ecology Project. The participants in the “News”
pilot study group for MEP, for example, have initiated a search across select
media archives focused on the keyword “protest”. The range of semantic values
of this term, and scope of attendant historical events and formats of
coverage, will provide a rich test case to demonstrate the new capacities for
scholarship that The Boston TV News Digital Library realizes within its own
collection and in relation to other collections. Such scholarship can
facilitate and/or be facilitated by online practices of curation and
categorizations, metadata generation, and emerging inter-disciplinary dynamics
related to data-mining. The efforts at WGBH, Northeast Historic Film,
Cambridge Community Television, and The Boston Public Library to digitize,
make available, and augment (produce blogs, curatorial notes, and other
finding aids) regarding these historic media materials are exemplary 21st
Century archival and scholarly
achievements.
