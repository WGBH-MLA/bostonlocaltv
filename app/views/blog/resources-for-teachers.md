# Resources for Teachers

This project is a collaborative community effort to build a central repository
of local historical digitized news. We hope teachers will use the video
resources to enhance their lessons. In addition to the videos and descriptions
available directly through our website, PBS LearningMedia has created <a
href="http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/collection/bln12/">video resources</a>
from our archival collection, along with a <a

plan</a>.

We're proud to showcase the work students have done with materials from our
collection. As a final product from the PBS LearningMedia lesson plan,
students can write blogs posts about their work with primary sources. These
are submitted to us by the teacher, and published on our
website.
<div id="digitization"><strong>Request
Digitization</strong></div>
We’re very excited to offer a remarkable feature that allows users to access
any item in our catalog. Through our Digitization on Demand program you can
select any artifact from our catalog of over 50,000 items, and help save a
piece of local history by sponsoring its preservation. It’s easy. If you come
across an items that you’re excited to see digitized and preserved, all you
have to do is request it. We’ll contact you about the costs of digitization,
and soon the video will be streaming on our site for free public access. Read
