# Coming Soon... the CATALOG

If you've been following this blog you've been hearing about all of the fun
and interesting stories we've discovered in the process of transcribing and
cataloging the WHDH and WCVB paper
catalogs.

In a few weeks, you'll be able to search the catalog <strong>yourself</strong>
and discover stories that may be of interest to
<strong>you</strong>.

Our web team is working on launching a new site (at this address) which will
include this blog as well as the full catalog and pages for each collection.
The site is being built using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>
and <a href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a> and custom
design.

Here is a
preview...

new site will be the ability for users to comment and vote on the catalog
records. So, for example, if you find story that you recall and want to
discuss it, you will be able to add your comments. Or if there is a story that
is particularly meaningful to you, you can vote for that piece of film to be
preserved, digitized and posted online for all to see. This is our first foray
into <strong>crowdsourcing selection for preservation</strong> and we are
excited to see what our users are excited to
see!
