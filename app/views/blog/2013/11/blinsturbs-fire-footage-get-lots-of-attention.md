Great news! Over the past 2 days we've had an unprecedented number of new
visitors to the site. <strong>Over
750!</strong>

The vast majority of these visitors have been finding us through a Facebook
shout out we got from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DirtyOldBoston">Dirty
Old Boston</a>, on the <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org/catalog/BPL_XRLDNXPHU4DE1WK">WHDH footage</a>
about the Blinstrub's nightclub fire in 1968. Check out the footage yourself.
It's a great piece on a tragic event that is remembered by many in our local
Boston
community.

There are many of these gems in our collections. And a lot of them haven't
been digitized yet. If you search our non-video assets, and come across a
story you think you remember or you' be interested in seeing streaming online,
let us know! Email us at bostonlocaltv@wgbh.org, and we'll work as hard as we
can to get you and the general public access to that
footage.
