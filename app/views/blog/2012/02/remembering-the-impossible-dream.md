# Remembering the Impossible Dream

By Laura
Hayner

After many weeks of joining my fellow WGBH and BPL interns in puzzling over
curious, sparse and vague WHDH catalog cards, I was surprised to come across
several that were crammed with text, directing footage seekers to several
reels of film. Almost all entries were dated; many made detailed note of the
location where the footage was shot, of interesting personalities featured and
of the activities caught on film. The volume of descriptive information was
much greater than on the cards surrounding them. What garnered so much
attention? Required so much
detail?

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_red_sox">Red Sox</a>!
(Duh.)

Ladies and gentlemen, I present a brief history of “<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Boston_Red_Sox_season">The Impossible
Dream</a>.” The year was 1967. The Red Sox hadn’t been doing so hot. Fans had
low expectations. Yet, the season started out strong. Team captain <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Yastrzemski">Carl Yastrzemski</a>, an
outfielder in his eighth year with the Red Sox, set multiple team records,
becoming the first player since <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Williams">Ted Williams</a> to achieve a
<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Triple_Crown">Triple
Crown</a>.  The team went on to beat the<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins"> Minnesota Twins</a> and
win the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_league">American
League</a> Championship, 21 years after their last Pennant victory in 1946, by
one
game.

Given the dates on this batch of catalog cards, most of the footage seems to
depict the aftermath of that last game of the American League Championship
when the Sox sealed their place in the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_series">World Series</a>. Additional
footage appears to show hometown enthusiasm on World Series home game days.
And then there’s a line, dated 10/12/67, titled “FENWAY PARK OBIT,” for the
day the Sox lost game seven and the World Series victory to the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals">St. Louis
Cardinals</a>.

The dogged reporters and camera operators captured a variety of footage of the
Sox and their fans, both excited and eccentric. Here’s a
breakdown:

The good: “LOCKER ROOM champagne scenes after / twins victory” on 10/1/67.
Also, “Red Sox wives;” the first reality
show?

The bad: “KENMORE SQ night scenes celebration after / Red Sox defeated
Minnesota…police..crowds / and someone hurt being
removed.”

The weird: “WHEELBARROW. Man being pulled / to game after winning bet.” Can
someone re-enact this for
me?

It is said that 1967 is the year that revitalized Red Sox fans and made them
what they are today. While footage of this landmark season is available, I
hope these newsreels show newsgathering at its best, with reporters and
cameramen flying by the seat of their pants to faithfully cover these historic
games and surrounding local
fervor.

Intern disclaimer: I am not from here. I grew up in the Chicago suburbs
pretending to understand basketball and idolizing <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_jordan">Michael Jordan</a> <em>who
lived ten minutes from my house</em>! Anyway, while I have double-checked my
Red Sox facts, if I did make any errors, please leave corrections in the
comments. And maybe throw in a phonetic pronunciation guide for the name
“Yastrzemski.”
