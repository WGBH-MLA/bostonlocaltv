# Vote, Vote, Vote!

We want you to help us decide what stories are digitized to stream on the <a
href="http://bostonlocaltv.org">Boston TV News Digital Library</a> website.
Browse our collections, or search for specific events or people, and then
choose "Vote for this video." Voting is limited to one vote per person per
story.

Once we have your suggestions, we will base digitization on the number of
votes received, as well as any issues relating to copyright and other legal
issues.

Thank you for helping us choose what everyone will see on the website. Happy
voting!
